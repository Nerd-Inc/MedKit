Abdominal Pain**************************************************
Pain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (for 
example, skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (for 
example, beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called "referred" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area.
 
Abnormal Facial Expressions**************************************************
Abnormal facial expressions can occur as a result of conditions that damage the nerves to the face, such as Bell's palsy or facial paralysis. Damage to the brain, such as with stroke or transient ischemic attack, can also cause impaired movement, including changes in facial expressions. Patients with a number of psychiatric conditions may display abnormal facial expressions, particularly the psychotic disorders, in which an individual's sense of reality is impaired. Facial tics, such as those that occur in Tourette syndrome, are one form of abnormal facial expressions. 
 
Loss of Speech**************************************************

Lack of speech or absence of speech can occur due to both medical and psychological conditions. Absent speech or mutism can occur as a sign of catatonia, a state in which one is unresponsive but otherwise awake. Catatonia can be a sign or schizophrenia or other psychiatric conditions involving psychosis. It may also be a sign of severe depression or other emotional disorders. The antipsychotic medications listed below are used in the treatment of emotional conditions that may manifest as catatonia with lack of speech.
 
Acid Reflux (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease or GERD)**************************************************
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or acid reflux, 
has a number of different causes. Heartburn is the pain characteristically associated with acid reflux and results from irritation of the lining of the esophagus. Some cases of heartburn can produce sharp chest pains in the mid-chest that can be mistaken for the pain of angina. Heartburn is typically worse when an individual lies down after eating and occurs most commonly after mealtimes.
 
Acute Sinusitis**************************************************

The symptoms of acute sinusitis arise from inflammation of the lining tissues of the paranasal sinuses. This condition often occurs with rhinitis (inflammation of the lining of the nose), and symptoms can include nasal congestion, runny nose, nasal pressure, headache, fever, cough, and tenderness of the face over the areas of the sinuses. Other symptoms that can be related to sinusitis are tooth pain, jaw pain, postnasal drip, redness of the nose, reddened cheeks, red eyelids, decreased sense of taste, decreased sense of smell, ear fullness, and nasal drainage. Generalized symptoms like fatigue are also typical.

 
Inattention**************************************************

Inattention is the lack of focus when focus on a given event or situation is required. Inattention is a hallmark feature of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can affect adults as well as children and teens. Inattention in ADHD is often accompanied by symptoms such as restlessness, problems doing quiet activities, problems with executive function, talking excessively, and fidgeting.  Inattention can also occur due to external factors such as distractions as well as situations of emotional stress, anxiety, conflict, anger, or other mood changes. Inattention can also be related to medical problems that interfere with an individual's cognitive function, such as stroke or dementia. Inattention can be seen in typical young children and  is classified as a disorder only when present to excess and accompanied by problems with normal function. Depression and related conditions can cause mood changes that may include lack of attention and interest in normal daily activities.
 
ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)**************************************************

While inattention and hyperactivity are the cardinal symptoms of ADHD, a number of other symptoms are contained within the diagnostic criteria for this condition and are typical for those with ADHD. 

 
Alcohol Poisoning**************************************************

Alcohol poisoning is a term used by many people to refer to alcohol overdose. Alcohol overdose can cause a number of serious health consequences, including coma and death. In addition to the typical symptoms of drunkenness, which begin early in the process, alcohol poisoning also affects breathing, regulation of body temperature, and can lead to seizures. Alcohol also inhibits the gag reflex, which means that people with alcohol overdose may choke on their own vomit. Hypothermia (low body temperature) and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) are complications of alcohol poisoning along with irregular heartbeat and slowed and irregular breathing.
 
Alcohol Withdrawal**************************************************

Alcohol withdrawal occurs when a person who is accustomed to drinking large amounts of alcohol suddenly stops drinking alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually are most severe after 48 to 72 hours, but they can persist for weeks. A severe form of alcohol withdrawal is called delirium tremens (DT).
 
Allergy**************************************************
Allergies are exaggerated immune responses to environmental triggers known as allergens. Allergies are very common, and about 50 million people in North America suffer from allergies. One of the most common forms of allergy is allergic rhinitis ("hay fever"), which produces symptoms like
 
Altered Mental Status**************************************************
An alteration in mental status refers to general changes in brain function, such as confusion,  amnesia (memory loss), loss of alertness, 
disorientation (not cognizant of self, time, or place), defects in judgment or thought, unusual or strange behavior, poor regulation of emotions, and disruptions in perception, psychomotor skills, and behavior. While an altered mental status is obviously characteristic of a number of psychiatric and emotional conditions, medical conditions and injuries that cause damage to the brain, including 
alcohol or drug overdose and withdrawal syndromes, can also cause mental status changes. Confusion, lethargy, delirium, dementia, encephalopathy, and organic brain syndrome are all terms that have been used to refer to conditions hallmarked by mental status changes.
 
Alzheimer's Disease**************************************************

Alzheimer's disease is a common cause of dementia and its associated symptoms. Memory problems that develop slowly over time are often the main or first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Later symptoms can include personality changes like apathy, withdrawal, and reduced spontaneity. Trouble with abstract thinking and significant cognitive loss can develop with time. Other symptoms of the mental decline seen in people with Alzheimer's disease can include loss of orientation (to person, place, or time), agitation, irritability, quarrelsomeness, and a diminishing ability to care for him- or herself and to dress appropriately. Mood changes, wandering, erratic behavior, uncooperativeness, and anger can be seen in the later stages of the disease. Physical symptoms can include loss of bowel control or urinary incontinence.

 
Anal Itching (Pruritus Ani)**************************************************
Anal itching (pruritus ani) is due to irritation of the skin around the anus accompanied by a desire to scratch. The intensity of itching increases with moisture, pressure, and sitting. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort described as burning and soreness. Scratching only makes the discomfort worse.  Treatment of anal itching is to shower gently without directly rubbing or irritating the skin and to clean and pat dry the anus thoroughly. Use of moist pads rather than toilet paper after bowel movements can be helpful. Local application of cortisone cream may also reduce inflammation and itching, though prolonged use of cortisone may be damaging to the skin. If anal itching is prolonged, a physician should be consulted and a search made for the cause.
 
Anaphylaxis**************************************************

Anaphylaxis is a rare, severe allergic reaction that is life-threatening. The most common allergic triggers of anaphylaxis include drugs (such as penicillin), 
insect stings, 
foods (peanuts, shellfish), X-ray dye, and 
latex. Symptoms 
and signs can vary and begin either immediately after contact with the allergen or after a short time period (15 minutes to an hour).  Hives, difficulty breathing, a feeling of impending doom, and reduced blood pressure are among the symptoms 
and signs that can occur. The severity of symptoms and signs varies among people; the more rapid the onset of symptoms 
and signs, the greater the likelihood of a severe reaction.

 
Anemia**************************************************
Anemia is the condition of having less than the normal number of red blood 
cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. The 
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is, as a result, decreased. People with anemia may 
experience the following symptoms and signs:
 
Angular Cheilitis**************************************************

Angular cheilitis is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth. Angular cheilitis is sometimes referred to as angular stomatitis. The inflammation can cause pain in the lips, cracked lips, ulceration, reddened skin, and tenderness at the involved area. Typically, both sides of the mouth are involved, but the condition can occur on one side only. Drooling or dry mouth are sometimes associated symptoms.

 
Ankle Pain**************************************************

The ankle joint is the meeting of the bones of the leg and the foot and is responsible for the up and down motion of the foot. In popular usage, the ankle is often considered to be the ankle joint plus the surrounding anatomic region, including the lower end of the leg and the start of the flat part of the foot. Pain in the ankle can result from inflammation or injury to any of the structures in this region, including the bones, joint space, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, or muscles. Ankle pain can be associated with other symptoms including
 
Anxiety**************************************************
Anxiety is a feeling of apprehension and fear characterized by physical symptoms such as
 
Loss of Speech**************************************************

Lack of speech or absence of speech can occur due to both medical and psychological conditions. Absent speech or mutism can occur as a sign of catatonia, a state in which one is unresponsive but otherwise awake. Catatonia can be a sign or schizophrenia or other psychiatric conditions involving psychosis. It may also be a sign of severe depression or other emotional disorders. The antipsychotic medications listed below are used in the treatment of emotional conditions that may manifest as catatonia with lack of speech.
 
Appendicitis**************************************************

Abdominal pain is the main symptom of appendicitis. The pain starts out as diffuse, meaning it is difficult to localize the area of pain. Most people say the initial pain of appendicitis occurs around the middle portion of the abdomen. As the inflammation of the appendix progresses, the pain becomes localized to one area. Once the peritoneum (lining tissue of the abdomen) is inflamed, the pain of appendicitis is characteristically located at a point between the navel and the front of the right hip bone. Anatomically, this is referred to as McBurney's point.
 
Arm Pain**************************************************

Pain in the arm can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities or injury of the skin, nerves, bones, joints, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the arm can all result in pain. Arm pain, depending on the location and cause, may be accompanied by numbness, redness, swelling, tenderness, or stiffness of the joints. Injuries or trauma to any part of the arm or shoulder, including bone fractures, joint dislocations, and muscle strains and sprains, are common causes of arm pain. Sometimes diseases that affect other organs in the body, like peripheral vascular disease or arthritis, can be the cause of pain in the arm. Causes of arm pain range from mild annoyances to severe and potentially life-threatening occurrences, such as chest pain from myocardial infarction (heart attack) and angina pectoris that may radiate (spread) to the arm area. The pain of a heart attack can be accompanied by nausea, difficulty breathing, a sense of pressure on the chest, and other symptoms. Treatments for arm pain depend on the underlying cause.
 
Asthma**************************************************
Symptoms of asthma develop as a result of the narrowing and inflammation of the airways. Wheezing is a characteristic symptom of asthma, along with shortness of breath. Chest pain or tightness can accompany an asthma attack. Coughing can also be a symptom of asthma. The cough associated with asthma is often worse at night or in the early morning. Nighttime cough can lead to problems with sleep.
 
Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**************************************************
Symptoms of atrial fibrillation occur when the upper chambers of the heart (atria) beat in a disorganized fashion. Atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia. Characteristic symptoms include shortness of breath, palpitations, and lightheadedness. In some cases, chest pain can be an associated symptom, particularly if there is also cardiovascular disease present.  (Chest pain or pressure warrants urgent medical evaluation.) Other symptoms of atrial fibrillation are fatigue, confusion, and a reduced tolerance for exercise.
 
Atrial Flutter**************************************************

Atrial flutter is a type of abnormal heartbeat or arrhythmia.  It is characterized by a fast heart rate and a reduction in cardiac output that leads to characteristic symptoms. Palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, and poor exercise tolerance are the most common symptoms. Other less common symptoms can include lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, or chest pain. Blood clots may form in the heart (thrombi) that may break off and travel to other parts of the body (emboli), leading to complications. The reduction in cardiac output (decreased volume of blood pumped by the heart), when untreated, can have serious consequences, including congestive heart failure, stroke, and heart attack.
 
Inattention**************************************************

Inattention is the lack of focus when focus on a given event or situation is required. Inattention is a hallmark feature of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can affect adults as well as children and teens. Inattention in ADHD is often accompanied by symptoms such as restlessness, problems doing quiet activities, problems with executive function, talking excessively, and fidgeting.  Inattention can also occur due to external factors such as distractions as well as situations of emotional stress, anxiety, conflict, anger, or other mood changes. Inattention can also be related to medical problems that interfere with an individual's cognitive function, such as stroke or dementia. Inattention can be seen in typical young children and  is classified as a disorder only when present to excess and accompanied by problems with normal function. Depression and related conditions can cause mood changes that may include lack of attention and interest in normal daily activities.
 
Autism**************************************************

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of neurodevelopmental disorders predominantly characterized by impaired social functioning and communication disturbances. Symptoms can include intense focus on one item, unresponsiveness, lack of understanding social cues (like tone of voice or body language), repetitive movements, or self-abusive behavior like head-banging. The severity of the symptoms varies widely among affected individuals. Other possible symptoms include learning to speak relatively late, not playing interactively with other children, avoidance of eye contact, lack of empathy, and social withdrawal. Children with ASD who have not developed sufficient language skills may act out, including screaming or crying, to express their needs. It is important to note that people with ASD may vary widely in their level of functioning, and not all people with ASD will experience all of the symptoms listed.
 
Bird Flu (Avian Influenza, Avian Flu)**************************************************

Bird flu (avian flu or avian influenza) is type of influenza virus that mainly affects wild or domesticated birds. Bird flu spreads easily among birds, although transmission to humans is not common. Most human infections occur after exposure to infected birds or their droppings. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus arose in the late 1990s and proved to be highly pathogenic (causing severe illness and death) in birds. Since then, other strains of bird flu have been identified that also have the ability to cause severe disease and death. Human infections with a new avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013.
 
Lower Back Pain**************************************************
There are many causes of pain in the back. Symptoms in the low back can be a result of problems in the bony lumbar spine, discs between the vertebrae, ligaments around the spine and discs, spinal
cord and nerves, muscles of the low back, internal organs of the pelvis and abdomen, and
the skin covering the lumbar area. Pains in the upper back can also be a result of disorders of the aorta, chest tumors, and inflammation of spine.
 
Bad Breath**************************************************

Bad breath, medically known as halitosis, is a common problem. Bad breath is usually simple and preventable. Dietary factors as well as tobacco and alcohol use may all be factors in causing bad breath. Poor oral hygiene, gum disease, tooth decay, or mouth infections can also be causes of halitosis. Infections in the lungs, sinuses, or airways can also cause bad breath due to the presence of nasal secretions that may drain into the mouth. Chronic postnasal drip, for example as occurs with sinus infections, can be a cause of bad breath. Coughing up sputum from lung infections can also cause bad breath. Dry mouth (xerostomia) can be a side effect of certain medications, increasing the tendency to develop bad breath. Certain chronic diseases that severely restrict liver or kidney function may also alter the odor of the breath. Other chronic conditions that can be associated with bad breath include diabetes and acid reflux disease.
 
Bad Taste in the Mouth**************************************************

A bad taste in the mouth can be a result of a wide range of medical conditions and even everyday situations. It may occur after eating, after coughing, or constantly, depending upon the cause. Many different kinds of prescription or over-the-counter medications can interfere with the sense of taste and may produce an unpleasant sensation of taste. The feeling of a bad taste in the mouth is usually temporary and improves when the underlying cause is remedied. Consumption of certain foods, or the use of tobacco products, can result in an unpleasant or bad taste in the mouth. Poor dental health and poor hygiene are other potential causes of a bad taste in the mouth. 
 
Beau's Lines**************************************************

Beau's lines are horizontal or transverse depressions in the nail (they can be seen in the fingernails, thumbs, toenails, or all nails) that may be confused with  
nail ridging. This phenomenon was originally described in 1846 by the French physician Joseph Honoré Simon Beau. These 
lines are caused by diseases that affect the entire body, including malnutrition, heart attack (myocardial infarction), liver diseases, severe infections (such as mumps, measles, pneumonia, and others), and metabolic disturbances, including poorly controlled diabetes. However, Beau's lines can result from any disease process or illness that is severe enough to affect the growth plate of the nail. Malnutrition and chemotherapy drugs for cancer can also cause Beau's lines. Trauma or injury may also be a cause of Beau's lines or nail ridges. The timing of the disease can be estimated by measuring the distance from the Beau's line to the nail bed.

 
Unusual Behavior**************************************************

The observation of strange behavior depends at least in part upon the perceptions of the observer. For most people, behaviors that are observed as out of the ordinary or strange are a feature of psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other mental-health conditions. Examples of conditions in which psychosis (altered perception of reality) are present include schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. People suffering from psychosis may have an altered perception of reality that often affects their behavior, leading them to act in ways that may be perceived as strange. Problems controlling one's behavior can also occur as a result of brain damage or disorders. People suffering from dementia may display strange behaviors. Behavioral changes can be accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms or by physical symptoms if they are related to a medical condition.  Substance abuse and drug overdoses can also lead to problems with behavior.
 
Benign Positional Vertigo**************************************************

In benign positional vertigo, the sufferer develops a sense of spinning that comes on suddenly. This usually happens when one is moving the head. Those affected may have the feeling that the world is spinning around them. Vision problems, like the perception that things are moving, can accompany the vertigo, as well as blurring of vision. Benign positional vertigo usually lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes. Other symptoms that can occur include loss of balance, nausea, vomiting, and hearing loss. 

 
Binge Eating Disorder**************************************************
The hallmark symptom of binge eating disorder is recurring episodes of bingeing, or eating excessive amounts of food at one time, without associated purging behaviors like vomiting, 
exercising, or medication abuse. Other symptoms include
 
Bipolar Disorder**************************************************
The symptoms of bipolar disorder depend upon whether the sufferer is experiencing a depressive or manic episode. A person must have experienced at least one manic episode to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Symptoms and signs of manic episodes include elevated or expansive mood, rushed or pressured speech, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, poor judgment, increased goal-directed activity, impulsivity, grandiose thoughts (thinking one has superpowers or special abilities), and tangential speech (switching topics frequently).
 
Bird Flu (Avian Influenza, Avian Flu)**************************************************

Bird flu (avian flu or avian influenza) is type of influenza virus that mainly affects wild or domesticated birds. Bird flu spreads easily among birds, although transmission to humans is not common. Most human infections occur after exposure to infected birds or their droppings. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus arose in the late 1990s and proved to be highly pathogenic (causing severe illness and death) in birds. Since then, other strains of bird flu have been identified that also have the ability to cause severe disease and death. Human infections with a new avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013.
 
Bladder Infection**************************************************
Symptoms of a bladder infection are similar to those of any lower urinary 
tract infection (UTI). These symptoms are similar in men, women, and children. 
The main symptoms of bladder infection are
 
Bladder Spasms**************************************************

A bladder spasm occurs when the bladder muscle squeezes suddenly without warning, causing an urgent need to release urine. A bladder spasm is referred to medically as a contraction of the detrusor muscle. The spasm can be so severe as to cause the leakage of urine (incontinence), which is characteristic of the condition urge incontinence, or overactive bladder. Sometimes, a bladder spasm is associated with severe cramping, burning, or pain. Bladder spasms can occur in people of any age. They are a common cause of daytime incontinence in children. They can be related to medical conditions that interfere with the function of the nervous system or may be related to infections or damage to the bladder itself. Certain medications and foods are also irritating to the bladder and may cause bladder spasms.
 
Bleeding Gums**************************************************

Bleeding, redness, and painful or sore gums can be a symptom of gingivitis (inflammation of the gums) that arises due to a number of different causes. Bleeding of the gums is sometimes referred to as gingival bleeding, and it may occur during brushing or flossing. The soreness can be accompanied by swelling of the gum tissues. Most commonly, gingivitis is the result of plaque buildup on the teeth around the gum line. Without adequate removal, the plaque hardens to become tartar, which worsens gingivitis and can, over time, lead to receding gums and even damage the bones of the jaws. Bleeding from the gums, particularly when accompanied by easy bruising and/or bleeding at other sites in the body, can also be caused by diseases that interfere with the normal blood-clotting process. Blood-thinner medications are another potential cause of bleeding gums. The hormonal changes during pregnancy can also increase the sensitivity of the gums, which may lead to increased bleeding in some cases. Those with chronic conditions that affect the function of the immune system, such as HIV infection or diabetes, may also have an increased tendency to develop gingivitis.
 
Blisters**************************************************

Blisters are small raised areas that are filled with fluid and located in the superficial layer of the skin. They look like bubbles on the surface of the skin. Although they are often caused by irritation or friction (such as with a poorly fitting shoe), blisters can also represent disease processes. Blisters can accompany some types of skin rashes and inflammatory conditions, including certain autoimmune diseases. Depending upon the cause of the blisters, blisters may occur singly or in groups. In contrast to abscesses and boils, which are collections of inflammatory fluid found deep in the tissues, blisters are found in the most superficial layer of skin.
 
Blood Clot**************************************************

Blood clotting is a normal process that prevents loss of blood. However, sometimes disorders of the clotting system or injuries cause blood clots to form when they are not needed. In this case, the clots may cause significant complications. Blood clots can form in the veins (blood vessels that return blood to the heart after oxygen has been used by the tissues) and in the arteries (blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to all parts of the body). Symptoms of a blood clot depend on the location of the clot.
 
Blood in Semen**************************************************
Blood in semen (ejaculate) is also called hematospermia. 
Blood in semen can be caused by many conditions affecting the tubes that 
distribute semen from the testicles (seminal vesicles) or the prostate gland. 
The most common cause of blood in semen is inflammation of the seminal vesicles 
or prostate gland. Blood in the semen can temporarily be caused by injury to the 
prostate gland, such as from prostate biopsy.
 
Blood in Urine**************************************************
Blood in the urine may or may 
not be accompanied by pain, but it is always abnormal and should be 
further investigated by a health care professional. Painful blood in the urine can be caused by a number of 
disorders, including stones and infections in the urinary tract. 
Painless blood in the urine can also be due to many causes, including cancer. 
Blood in the urine is also referred to as hematuria. Visible blood in the urine is referred to as gross hematuria, while blood in the urine that is not visible to the naked eye is referred to as microscopic hematuria.
 
Nosebleed**************************************************
The nose is a part 
of the body that is very rich in blood vessels (vascular) 
and is situated in a vulnerable position on the face. As a 
result, any trauma to the face can cause a bloody nose, and bleeding may 
be profuse.  Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the 
nasal membranes dry out, crust, and crack, as is common in 
dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is 
dry and warm from household heaters. People are more 
susceptible if they are taking medications that prevent 
normal blood clotting (Coumadin, warfarin, aspirin, or any 
anti-inflammatory medication). Other predisposing factors 
include infection, trauma, allergic and non-allergic 
rhinitis, hypertension, alcohol abuse, and inherited 
bleeding problems.
 
Bloody Sputum (Hemoptysis)**************************************************
Bloody sputum (spitting up blood or bloody mucus) can come from common forms of infection in the lungs and airways, such as acute bronchitis or pneumonia. Bloody sputum can be a result of lung cancer. Whenever bloody sputum is present and cannot be attributed to a curable condition, a complete lung evaluation is warranted. Bloody sputum is also referred to as hemoptysis.
 
Flat Affect**************************************************

A flat affect is the loss or lack of emotional responses to a situation or event that would typically elicit emotion. People with flat affect may appear to be completely unemotional or apathetic. Other associated symptoms include speaking in a monotone voice and a reduction in facial expressions. A flat affect is sometimes referred to as a blunted affect, although a blunted affect often refers to a reduction in emotions that is not as severe as that seen with flat affect. Flat affect can occur in association with schizophrenia or in some types of depression. 
 
Blurred Vision**************************************************

Blurred vision refers to a lack of sharpness of vision resulting in the inability to see fine detail. Blurred vision may result from abnormalities such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, presbyopia, or astigmatism that can be improved with 
corrective lenses (eyeglasses) or it may signal the presence of eye disease. Blurry vision may be experienced in one eye or in both eyes, depending upon the cause. Blurred vision can also be a symptom of numerous conditions that do not directly involve the eye, such as migraine or stroke. A number of medications may also lead to temporary blurring of vision as a side effect. Sometimes, blurred vision is associated with other symptoms, depending upon its cause, including headache, 
sensitivity to light, or 
redness and irritation of the eyes.
 
Osteopenia**************************************************

Osteopenia is a bone condition characterized by a decreased density of bone, but the density is not decreased enough to warrant a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteopenia leads to bone weakening and an increased risk of breaking a bone (fracture). Osteopenia represents a lesser degree of bone loss than osteoporosis. When there are other risk factors present (like corticosteroid medication use, smoking, or other bone conditions) that also increase the risk of 
bone fractures, medications may be required.

 
Fecal Incontinence**************************************************

Fecal incontinence refers to the inability to hold feces (stool) in the rectum. This is typically due to failure of voluntary control over the anal sphincters, permitting untimely passage of feces and gas. Fecal incontinence is also known as rectal incontinence or bowel incontinence. Fecal incontinence is not a disease itself but is a symptom that can occur as a result of different kinds of diseases or injuries. Incontinence of stool can result from damage to the nerves or muscles of the rectum and anus, or conditions affecting the intestines. Overflow incontinence, also known as paradoxical diarrhea, occurs in people with chronic constipation when stool fills the rectum, hardens, and becomes impacted. Liquid stool then may leak around the fecal mass, producing symptoms similar to incontinence.

 
Brain Aneurysm**************************************************

A brain aneurysm is a bulging area within the wall of an artery that supplies the brain. In most cases, brain aneurysms do not produce symptoms. In some cases, the aneurysm may cause symptoms by pushing on other areas of the brain. Depending on the size of the aneurysm and the area involved, these symptoms can include headaches, neck pain, blurred vision, and speech changes. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, there is bleeding within the brain. Symptoms of a ruptured brain aneurysm come on suddenly and include a severe, sudden headache that is different from other headaches an individual has experienced. Other symptoms of rupture are neck pain, sensitivity to light, nausea, vomiting, seizures, fainting, and loss of consciousness. A brain aneurysm is also known as a cerebral aneurysm or a cerebral artery aneurysm.
 
Concussion**************************************************

A concussion is a form of minor brain trauma in which the function of the brain becomes altered but no abnormalities can be detected by imaging tests such as CT scans. Symptoms of a concussion are typically short-lived and go away on their own. The symptoms may be obvious or may be so subtle that the affected person does not realize they have suffered a concussion. Some of the more common symptoms of concussion include
 
Brain Tumor**************************************************
The symptoms of a brain tumor vary according to the size, type, and location of the tumor. Symptoms typically arise because of destruction or damage to the brain, swelling of the brain, or blockage of the flow of fluid that flows around the brain and spinal cord.
 
Breast Cancer**************************************************

Early symptoms and signs of breast cancer are typically not recognizable; this is why screening mammography is valuable to detect cancers at a very early stage. Even larger breast cancers do not always produce symptoms 
and signs. When symptoms do occur, the most common symptom is
 
Breast Discharge (Nipple Discharge)**************************************************
Breast discharge is the spontaneous flow of fluid from the nipple at any time other than during nursing. Breast discharge can be caused by a wide range of disorders, including breast cancer, breast ectasia, and breast infection. 
Sometimes it's possible to feel breast cancer as a breast lump. The breast lump may or may not be painful or tender. Breast duct malformation (duct ectasia) can lead to breast discharge. 
Mastitis is the medical term for a breast infection, and mastodynia is the 
medical term for breast pain. Another name for the nipple is areola. A 
physician should evaluate persisting breast discharge (nipple discharge).
 
Breast Lumps in Women**************************************************
Breast lumps are localized swellings, knots, bumps, bulges, or protuberances in the breast. Breast lumps may appear in both sexes at all ages. In women, the fear is usually of breast cancer, but fortunately many breast lumps turn out to be due to benign conditions that can be successfully treated, such as infection, trauma, fibroadenoma, cyst, or fibrocystic disease of the breast. Breast lumps may or may not be associated with
 
Breast Pain**************************************************
The most common cause of breast discomfort is from the 
effects of hormones on breast tissue from the female 
menstrual period. Many women experience mild monthly breast pain in conjunction with their periods 
(menses). For some women, however, the pain can be more severe. This 
premenstrual breast pain is referred to as cyclic
breast discomfort. The exact cause of cyclic breast discomfort has not been determined.

Brittle Nails**************************************************

Many medical conditions can affect the shape or texture of the fingernails. Brittleness of the nails, meaning that the nails easily become cracked, chipped, split, or peeled, can be observed as a sign of aging or in response to the long-term use of nail polish or exposure to moist conditions (including frequent swimming or dishwashing). Some diseases are also associated with changes in the nails, which can include brittleness. Thin and brittle nails can be a sign of hypothyroidism, for example. The term 
onychoschizia refers to splitting of the fingernails as well as brittle or soft nails. Taking biotin (a 
vitamin) supplements can help in some cases of brittle nails, and application of moisturizers after soaking in water can also be of benefit.
 
Bronchitis**************************************************
Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or airways that lead to the lungs. Acute bronchitis is sometimes referred to as a chest cold and can be caused by several types of viruses. Bacterial infections can also cause acute bronchitis. Bronchitis symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, chest soreness, sore throat, watery eyes, fatigue, mild headache, chills, and body aches. Fever may be present. The cough may bring up sputum, known as a productive cough.
 
Bumps on Skin**************************************************
People often describe localized swollen areas on, or 
under, the skin as lumps or bumps. While bumps on, or under, the skin may result 
from conditions that give rise to a skin rash, many other conditions can result in solitary raised 
lumps on the skin. Infections, tumors, and the body's response to trauma or 
injury can all lead to lumps or bumps that appear to be located on or underneath 
the skin. 
 
Burning Urination**************************************************
Burning urination or painful urination is also referred to as dysuria. A burning sensation with urination can be caused by infectious (including sexually transmitted infections, or STDs such as 
chlamydia and gonorrhea) and noninfectious conditions, but it is most commonly due to bacterial infection of the urinary tract affecting the bladder. It is often accompanied by other symptoms of urinary tract infections, such as dysuria (painful urination) or 
blood in the urine, and it can occur after intercourse in women when infection is present. Burning or painful urination during pregnancy is also suggestive of a urinary tract infection.
 
Bursitis**************************************************

Bursitis is the inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that act as cushions between areas of friction in the musculoskeletal system, such as between tendon and bone. Symptoms of bursitis can occur anywhere in the body 
where bursae are present, and the body contains about 160 bursae. Symptoms are often present in the bursae of the knee, elbow, shoulder, ankle, hip, thigh, or buttocks. 
Bursitis signs and symptoms include
 
Buttock Pain**************************************************

Many conditions and diseases can cause pain in the buttocks, commonly known as butt pain. Causes of pain in the buttocks range from temporary annoyances, such as bursitis, 
bruising, 
piriformis syndrome, muscle 
strain, and shingles, to more serious diseases with long-term consequences, such as cancer, arthritis of the sacroiliac joints, and herniated disc with sciatica. All symptoms related to buttock pain must be evaluated in terms of their intensity, duration, location, and aggravating or relieving factors. For examples, whether or not the pain changes when walking, when sitting, or when at rest while lying down. Buttock pain after running can be from muscle strain. It is also important to consider the presence or absence of accompanying medical issues in order to precisely identify the cause and to help formulate the optimal treatment for pain in the buttocks. These issues include 
incontinence, muscle spasms, painful 
bumps or rash, burning, hip pain, leg pain, and ankle pain.
 
Throat Cancer**************************************************

Throat cancers may not cause any symptoms if they are very small and have not spread at the time of diagnosis. Sometimes, an area of irritation or discoloration on the lining issues of the throat is the only sign of an abnormality. Depending upon the extent of spread of the cancer, other symptoms can include swelling of nearby tissues, 
enlarged lymph nodes, trouble breathing, difficulty speaking, neck or 
throat pain, 
ear pain, 
painful swallowing or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and headache. 
Pain or 
ringing in the ears may occur in some cases. Bleeding can occur from some throat cancers. In advanced stages of throat cancer, symptoms like fatigue and unexplained weight loss may be present.

 
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning**************************************************

Because the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be vague and nonspecific, the diagnosis may be missed or not suspected. Headache, dizziness, and nausea are the most common symptoms. Other possible symptoms include malaise, fatigue, chest pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, abdominal pain, or fecal and urinary incontinence. A number of different psychological and neurologic symptoms can also be present. These can include agitation, confusion, depression, lethargy, impulsiveness, hallucinations, confabulation, distractibility, and memory problems. Visual disturbances and seizure, as well as fainting (syncope), can also be related to carbon monoxide toxicity. Severe cases of carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to coma and death. 

 
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**************************************************

Carpal tunnel syndrome arises from compression of the median nerve that supplies the hand. Symptoms begin with numbness and/or tingling of the hand in the distribution of this nerve (the thumb, index, middle, and thumb side of the ring fingers).  These symptoms are usually worse at night and may even awaken the sufferer from sleep. Symptoms can occur for a short time or may persist and become chronic. As the condition worsens, symptoms can include a burning or painful sensation, cramping, shooting pains in the forearm, or weakness of the hand. This results in a loss of grip strength. If the condition is chronic, there can be wasting of the muscles of the hand (atrophy). 

 
Cat Scratch Disease**************************************************

Cat scratch disease, also known as catscratch disease, cat scratch fever, or subacute regional lymphadenitis, produces symptoms due to bacterial infection of the lymph nodes with bacteria known as 
Bartonella henselae. Most patients have a history of exposure to cats, and the disease begins with a reddish brown nodule (bump) at the site of infection. There is typically no pain or tenderness. Over the next weeks, there is enlargement of the lymph nodes that may be accompanied by tenderness. About half of patients have other symptoms like fever, malaise, joint pains, loss of appetite, fatigue, headache, and sore throat. Other less common symptoms that have been reported include rash, weight loss, seizures, mental status changes, numbness and tingling of the extremities, and irritation of the eyes.

 
Catatonia (Catatonic Behavior)**************************************************
Catatonia is a state of stupor or unresponsiveness in a person who is otherwise awake.  Catatonia can occur in association with a psychiatric disorder, like schizophrenia, or in association with a medical condition such as encephalitis. In some patients, catatonia may be present without a known cause. Catatonia is usually episodic, meaning that episodes of catatonia come and go. Symptoms that accompany catatonia can include
 
Cellulitis**************************************************

The symptoms of cellulitis result from inflammation of the skin and underlying tissues. The skin itself may appear reddened and warm to the touch, and there may be swelling, pain, and tenderness of the affected area. Red streaks on the skin can sometimes be seen when the infection is spreading. As the infection spreads, the affected person may develop fever and chills, with accompanying tiredness or malaise. Swollen lymph nodes can sometimes occur in areas near the infection.

 
Cervical Cancer**************************************************

In its early stages, cervical cancer typically does not cause symptoms. It may be detected on Pap screening and subsequent testing even before symptoms have developed. When symptoms do occur, one of the most common symptoms is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This can include bleeding between menstrual periods, bleeding after sexual intercourse or a pelvic exam, or bleeding after douching. Unusual or unexplained changes in the menstrual cycle, such as abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding after menopause, are also possible signs of cervical cancer.
 
Chapped Lips (Cheilitis)**************************************************

Cracks in the lips are most commonly associated with chapped lips, medically referred to as cheilitis simplex. 
Cheilitis is the term that denotes inflammation of the lips. Cracking, fissuring, reddening, peeling, and pain of the lips can occur when inflammation is present. Inflammation of the lips can be caused by many different conditions; in some cases, the condition can be chronic (persists over time). Wind, cold, and sun exposure are common environmental causes of cracked lips. Drug reactions, skin diseases, and other conditions can also cause inflammation of the lips. 

Angular cheilitis is the term used for inflammation (often with cracking) at the corners of the mouth; this condition is common in the elderly and is also called angular stomatitis. Allergic reactions are another common cause of inflammation of the lips.

 
Chest Pain**************************************************

There are many causes of chest pain. A serious form of chest pain is angina, which is a symptom of heart disease and results from inadequate oxygen supply to the heart muscle. Angina can be caused by coronary artery disease or spasm of the coronary arteries. Chest pain can also be due to a heart attack (coronary occlusion), aortic aneurysm dissection, myocarditis, esophageal spasm, esophagitis, rib injury or disease, anxiety, and other important diseases. Do not try to ignore chest pain and "work (or play) through it." Chest pain is a warning to seek medical attention.
 
Chills**************************************************
Chills are feelings of coldness accompanied by shivering. They may arise with or without fever. Without fever, chills typically arise after exposure to a cold environment. Essentially any condition that may produce fever (including infections and cancers) can result in chills along with fever. Fever and chills are common symptoms of influenza infection (the flu). Exposure to a cold environment can result in chills. With prolonged or constant exposure to cold, serious injuries related to hypothermia (a lowered core body temperature) can result. Chills in pregnancy are due to the same causes (hypothermia, infection) as chills in general.
 
Chlamydia**************************************************

Chlamydia is a common 
sexually transmitted disease (STD). It affects both men and women and, in most cases, does not cause any symptoms. When it does produce symptoms and signs, these may not appear for weeks after your infection. Symptoms in women include burning with urination and an abnormal vaginal discharge. Abdominal or pelvic pain is sometimes present. 
Blood in the urine, urinary urgency (feeling an urgent need to urinate), and increased urinary frequency can occur if the urethra is infected. In men, symptoms, when they occur, can include a discharge from the penis and a burning sensation when urinating. Pain in the testicles sometimes occurs. In both men and women, infection of the rectum can cause rectal pain, bleeding, and discharge from the rectum.

 
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome**************************************************

The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) means that the sufferer has experienced fatigue for at least six months in the absence of known medical causes as well as had other characteristic symptoms. 
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee recommends the name systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) for this disease, and it has also been referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), even though no evidence of inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) has been demonstrated with this condition.
 
Chronic Pain**************************************************
Chronic pain is pain (an unpleasant sense of discomfort) 
that persists or progresses over a long period of time. Chronic pain typically has persisted for at least three months. In contrast to acute pain that arises suddenly in response to a specific injury and is usually treatable, chronic pain persists over time and is often resistant to medical treatments. Chronic pain tends to interfere with the ability to perform activities of daily living and affects the quality of life.
 
Chronic Sore Throat**************************************************
Sore throat is most commonly an acute process that is the result of an infection such as the common cold or infectious mononucleosis. However, some chronic conditions like 
gastroesophageal reflux, some
cancers, chronic tonsillitis, and other conditions can lead to sore throat symptoms that last longer and persist (chronic sore throat). Symptoms that might be present, depending on the cause of the chronic sore throat, include
 
Cloudy Urine**************************************************

Normal urine is clear and has a straw-yellow color. When the urine does not have its characteristic clear appearance, it is often referred to as cloudy, turbid, or foamy urine. Cloudy or foamy urine may occur occasionally due to mild dehydration; when it occurs in the absence of symptoms and goes away rapidly, it is usually of little consequence. Certain conditions can cause excess protein or crystalline substances in the urine, causing it to persistently appear cloudy or foamy. Infections anywhere in the urinary tract (UTIs), including the bladder or urethra, in both men and women, can cause blood and pus to appear in the urine, giving it a cloudy appearance. Additionally, many of the numerous causes of blood in the urine can yield a cloudy or murky appearance to the urine due to the presence of blood. In women with vaginitis (such as yeast vaginitis or sexually transmitted infections 
[sexually transmitted diseases, STDs] like gonorrhea), the vaginal discharge, if present, may sometimes contaminate the urine sample, making the urine appear cloudy.
 
Vitamin B12 Deficiency**************************************************

Vitamin B12 is a vitamin that is essential for many body functions, including the production of red blood cells. The body cannot make vitamin B12, and it needs to be supplied through the diet or by taking supplements. Vitamin B12 is found in foods of animal origin like meats, eggs, milk, and cheese. Vitamin B12 deficiency 
(cobalamin deficiency) is a condition that results when there is too little vitamin B12 in the body. Pernicious anemia is a kind of anemia that happens when the body is not able to absorb vitamin B12 through the digestive tract. A mild deficiency of vitamin B12 may not produce symptoms. Symptoms and signs, when they occur, can be similar to those of anemia, including
 
Coccydynia**************************************************
Inflammation of the bony area (tailbone or coccyx) located between the buttocks is referred to as coccydynia. Coccydynia is associated with pain and tenderness at the tip of the tailbone between the buttocks. The pain is often worsened by sitting.None

 
Common Cold**************************************************
The common cold 
refers to a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Characteristic symptoms include
 
Cold Feet and Toes**************************************************

Cold sensations to the feet can come from poor circulation, disorders of the nervous system, cold exposure injuries such as frostbite, and decreased metabolism from a low thyroid condition (hypothyroidism or underactive thyroid). Depending upon the cause of the symptoms, coldness in the feet can be accompanied by other symptoms, including pain, numbness, changes in skin color, or a pins and needles tingling sensation. Other diseases that can cause cold feet symptoms include diabetes, arteriosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, and neuropathy of any cause.
 
Cold Fingers**************************************************
Cold sensations to the fingers can come from poor circulation, disorders of the nervous system, cold exposure, 
Raynaud's 
phenomenon, and low thyroid condition (hypothyroidism). Cold fingers may be associated with
 
Cold Hands**************************************************
Cold hands can arise due to cold exposure. Like cold sensation in the feet, cold hands can also be caused by problems with the circulation to the hands or with the nervous system. Some forms of thyroid disease can also result in the sensation of cold feet and hands.
 
Colitis**************************************************

Colitis is inflammation of the lining tissues of the large intestine (colon). People suffering from colitis may have typical symptoms 
and signs that include abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, and diarrhea. Some types of colitis may be associated with bloody diarrhea. Colitis can be part of a disease that affects other parts of the body, causing fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, and dehydration symptoms (weakness, decreased urine output). Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition that has other manifestations in the body, including mouth ulcers, joint swelling, and skin inflammation.
 
Colon Cancer**************************************************

Signs and symptoms of colon cancer tend not to be specific. In other words, the signs and symptoms can occur due to a number of different conditions. When colon cancer is detected in its early stages, it may not have even caused symptoms. Symptoms can also vary according to the specific location within the colon where the tumor is located.
 
Concussion**************************************************

A concussion is a form of minor brain trauma in which the function of the brain becomes altered but no abnormalities can be detected by imaging tests such as CT scans. Symptoms of a concussion are typically short-lived and go away on their own. The symptoms may be obvious or may be so subtle that the affected person does not realize they have suffered a concussion. Some of the more common symptoms of concussion include
 
Confusion**************************************************
Confusion is a change in mental status in which a person is not able to think 
with his or her usual level of clarity. Frequently, confusion leads to the loss 
of ability to recognize people and or places, or tell time and the date. Feelings of 
disorientation are common in confusion, and decision-making ability is impaired.

 
Constipation**************************************************
Constipation 
means different things to different people. For many people, it simply means 
infrequent stools. For others, however, constipation means hard stools, 
difficulty passing stools (straining), or a sense of incomplete emptying after a 
bowel movement. The cause of each of these types of constipation probably is 
different, and the approach to each should be tailored to the specific type of constipation. Constipation can also alternate with diarrhea. This pattern is more commonly considered as part of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). At the extreme end of the constipation spectrum is fecal impaction, a condition in which stool hardens in the rectum and prevents the passage of any stool.
 
Contact Dermatitis**************************************************

The main symptom of contact dermatitis is a skin rash. The rash may ooze or weep fluid and is typically located at the site of contact with the irritant that led to the contact dermatitis. The rash is often red in color and raised above the level of the skin.  The rash is usually accompanied by itching or burning, and the affected area may feel warm to the touch. Older lesions may scale over, thicken, and often remain itchy. 

 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**************************************************

COPD is characterized by a longstanding (chronic) obstruction to air flow out of the lungs. It can take different forms and have different symptoms. Symptoms of COPD can also vary in severity. Symptoms include a chronic cough, shortness of breath, and frequent respiratory infections. Other possible symptoms can include finger clubbing, wheezing, exercise intolerance, chest tightness, cough productive of sputum, and coughing up blood. The advanced stages of COPD can lead to symptoms like swelling of the feet and ankles, bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis), morning headaches, and weight loss.

 
Chronic Cough**************************************************
Cough is a rapid expulsion of air from the lungs 
typically in order to
clear the lung airways of fluids, mucus, or material. Cough is also called tussis. Cough can be categorized as acute (less than 
three weeks) or chronic (greater than three weeks).
 
Joint Cracking (Joint Popping)**************************************************
The symptom of joint cracking is described differently by different people while nevertheless representing the same condition. Various descriptions for the same process include "popping," "exploding," "noise," "snapping," and "creaking" of a joint. The cause of joint cracking depends on a number of conditions. Situational information that is essential in detecting the cause of joint popping includes whether it a singular episode of sounds coming from the joint or if it is a repeatable, recurrent event.
 
Crohn's Disease**************************************************

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestines that can affect any part of the digestive tract, causing ulcerations (breaks in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract). Some of the signs 
and symptoms of Crohn's disease include weight loss, pain, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and other symptoms. Bowel obstruction may be a complication of Crohn's disease. The condition can also affect other parts of the body like the spine, eyes, joints, and liver and may cause reddened, tender nodules in the skin. These manifestations of Crohn's disease outside the digestive tract are referred to as extraintestinal manifestations or extraintestinal Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease, together with another condition known as ulcerative colitis, are referred to as 
inflammatory bowel diseases.

 
Cyanosis (Turning Blue)**************************************************
Cyanosis is the medical term for a bluish color of the skin and the mucous membranes due to an insufficient level of oxygen in the blood. For example, the lips and fingernails may show cyanosis. Cyanosis can be evident at birth due to the presence of a heart malformation that permits blood that is not fully oxygenated to enter the arterial circulation. Cyanosis can also appear at any time later in life and often accompanies conditions in which lung function is compromised (resulting in an inability to fully oxygenate the blood) or conditions in which the heart's pumping function is compromised. The presence of abnormal forms of hemoglobin or other abnormalities of the blood cells can also sometimes cause cyanosis. The medical term for lowered oxygen levels is 
hypoxia; the term anoxia refers to the absence of oxygen.

 
Cystic Fibrosis**************************************************

Symptoms of cystic fibrosis mainly involve the lungs, pancreas, sex organs, intestines, and sinuses and arise from abnormal mucus that is unusually thick and sticky. The mucus buildup in the lungs leads to repeated infections with coughing, production of thick sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing, nasal congestion, and a decreased tolerance for exercise or physical activity. Other symptoms of cystic fibrosis include fatty, foul-smelling stools, constipation, and poor growth in children. Malnutrition and vitamin deficiency can arise because pancreatic enzymes may not reach the intestine. Abdominal pain and swelling can occur. Cystic fibrosis also causes the sweat to be excessively salty and can cause infertility in men.

 
Dark Circles Under the Eyes**************************************************

Dark circles under the eyes are a common complaint of both men and women, although they can occasionally be seen in children. As people age, the skin becomes thinner and collagen is lost, sometimes enhancing the appearance of blood vessels beneath the eyes and making the area appear darker. Dark circles under the eyes are not necessarily a sign of tiredness, but stress and fatigue seem to worsen the facial appearance of many people, including their tendency to develop dark circles.
 
Dark Urine**************************************************
Normal urine is clear and has a straw-yellow color. The color of the urine, however, can vary when foods of certain types are consumed or when certain medications are taken. Some substances that can change the color of the urine and potentially lead to darker urine are carotene, food colorings, beets, blackberries, laxatives, B complex 
vitamins, and drugs such as
Pyridium. The urine may also appear darker when there is 
bleeding into the urine, and the numerous causes of bloody urine (for 
example, infections, stones, cancer, trauma, kidney diseases) can all contribute to a darker appearance of the urine. In the presence of a urinary tract infection, the urine can also be cloudy and may appear darker. Jaundice, which is characterized by abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream, is caused by diseases of the liver 
or obstructions to the flow of bile pigment (by diseases of the head of the 
pancreas, diseases of the bile ducts, or the presence of stones in the bile 
duct) and can also be associated with darkening of the urine. It is wise to 
consult a health care practitioner about any change in urine appearance that is not related to diet and/or medications.
 
Decreased Appetite**************************************************
A decreased desire to eat is a symptom that is common to numerous medical and psychological conditions. Almost any illness can lead to a decrease in appetite. When severe, decreased appetite can lead to unwanted weight loss and malnutrition. Medically, a decrease in appetite is referred to as anorexia.
 
Osteopenia**************************************************

Osteopenia is a bone condition characterized by a decreased density of bone, but the density is not decreased enough to warrant a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteopenia leads to bone weakening and an increased risk of breaking a bone (fracture). Osteopenia represents a lesser degree of bone loss than osteoporosis. When there are other risk factors present (like corticosteroid medication use, smoking, or other bone conditions) that also increase the risk of 
bone fractures, medications may be required.

 
Dehydration**************************************************

Symptoms and signs of dehydration can be minor, such as increased thirst, or severe and life-threatening, depending on the extent of the dehydration. Along with thirst, initial symptoms of dehydration include reduced urine output and darkening of the urine as it becomes more concentrated. If the condition progresses, other symptoms develop, including dry mouth, decreased perspiration, lightheadedness, muscle cramps, weakness, palpitations, and absent tear production by the eyes. The skin may feel cool and clammy. Confusion, organ failure, and coma leading to death eventually occur if dehydration is not corrected.

 
Delirium**************************************************

Delirium refers to a state of severe confusion and rapid changes in brain function that comes on suddenly. It can be associated with hallucinations and hyperactivity, and the sufferer is inaccessible to normal contact. Delirium can occur due to a wide variety of causes, including head injury, drug use or withdrawal, poisonings, brain tumors, infections, and metabolic disturbances. A urinary tract infection or pneumonia, for example, may lead to delirium in older people. The prognosis of delirium depends upon the underlying cause of the condition. Delirium can also occur as a result of mental illness. Symptoms can include changes in alertness or level of consciousness, confusion, drowsiness, incontinence, delusions, changes in speech, emotional changes, decreases in memory, concentration problems, disorientation, disorganized thinking, and changes in perception. Delirium is sometimes mistaken for depression or dementia.
 
Delusions**************************************************

A delusion is a false personal belief that is not subject to reason or contradictory evidence and is not explained by a person's usual cultural and religious concepts (so that, for example, it is not an article of faith).  A delusion may be firmly maintained in the face of incontrovertible evidence that it is false. Delusions are common in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Delusions can also be a feature of brain damage or disorders. Delusions can be accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms or by physical symptoms when these occur related to a medical condition. Delusional disorder is a specific psychiatric condition that was formerly known as paranoid disorder. Examples of delusions include the sufferer believing that one has an unusual power or talent, believing that someone else (possibly a prominent figure or famous person) is in love with them, believing that one is being persecuted, or believing that one has a nonexistent medical problem.
 
Dengue**************************************************
Dengue infection is a leading cause of death and sickness in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. Dengue is caused by one of 
four viruses that are transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a more serious form of dengue infection.
 
Depigmentation of Skin**************************************************
Depigmentation of the skin can be caused by a number of 
local and systemic conditions. The pigment loss can be partial (such as after 
injury to the skin) or complete (such as from vitiligo). It can be temporary 
(such as from tinea versicolor) or permanent (such as from albinism). 

 
Depression**************************************************
Depression is an illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts and affects the way a person eats and 
sleeps, the way one feels about oneself, and the way one thinks about things. Depressive disorders are characterized by pervasive mood changes that affect all aspects of an individual's daily functioning. A depressive disorder is not the same as a passing blue mood and is more than a case of persistent sadness.
 
Bladder Spasms**************************************************

A bladder spasm occurs when the bladder muscle squeezes suddenly without warning, causing an urgent need to release urine. A bladder spasm is referred to medically as a contraction of the detrusor muscle. The spasm can be so severe as to cause the leakage of urine (incontinence), which is characteristic of the condition urge incontinence, or overactive bladder. Sometimes, a bladder spasm is associated with severe cramping, burning, or pain. Bladder spasms can occur in people of any age. They are a common cause of daytime incontinence in children. They can be related to medical conditions that interfere with the function of the nervous system or may be related to infections or damage to the bladder itself. Certain medications and foods are also irritating to the bladder and may cause bladder spasms.
 
Diabetes**************************************************

Symptoms of diabetes can be similar in type 1 diabetes, typically diagnosed in children and teens, and type 2 diabetes, which most often occurs in adults. Early symptoms of any type of diabetes are related to high blood and urine glucose levels and include dehydration, hunger, increased urination, and increased thirst. Other symptoms can include weight loss or gain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and increased susceptibility to infections. 
 Vaginal infections in women and yeast infections in both men and women are common. Other symptoms can include dry mouth, itching skin, and slow-healing wounds, cuts, or sores. 

 
Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**************************************************

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes that occurs when the body makes high levels of ketones due to lack of insulin. It is rare but possible for DKA to occur in people with type 2 diabetes. In diabetic ketoacidosis, elevated blood sugar, elevated ketone levels, and acidity of the blood (acidosis) interfere with many critical body functions. 
DKA symptoms can include
 
Diarrhea**************************************************
Diarrhea is a familiar phenomenon defined as 
unusually frequent or unusually soft or liquid bowel movements. It is the opposite of constipation. 
The word diarrhea with its odd spelling is a near steal from the 
Greek diarrhoia meaning "a flowing through."
 
Difficulty Concentrating**************************************************

Difficulty concentrating is a normal and periodic occurrence for most people. Tiredness and emotional stress can cause concentration problems in most people. Hormonal changes, such as those experienced during menopause or pregnancy, can also affect how we think and concentrate. Concentration problems, when present to an excessive degree, are also characteristic of certain physical and psychological conditions. The hallmark condition associated with difficulty concentrating is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD), a condition that has been increasingly diagnosed in both children an adults in recent years. Rare conditions that affect the brain and some emotional problems as well as endocrinologic disturbances can also influence an individual's cognitive functions and thus impair concentration.
 
Difficulty Urinating**************************************************

Difficulty urinating can be a result of anatomical abnormalities within the genitourinary tract. In men, enlargement of the prostate gland, due most commonly to benign prostatic hyperplasia and less commonly to prostate cancer, can cause difficulty urinating. In both men and women, difficulty urinating can result from neurological or muscular conditions that affect function of the bladder. When it becomes difficult to urinate, other symptoms such as dribbling (leaking or mild 
incontinence) and a weak urine stream may also be present. Certain medications can also cause problems with urination. 
Scar tissue from surgery or trauma can also cause problems with the flow of urine. 
Infections of the urinary tract or of the nervous system can also cause retention of urine.

 
Difficulty With Speech**************************************************

Difficulty with speech can be the result of problems with the brain or nerves that control the facial muscles, larynx, and vocal cords necessary for speech. Likewise, muscular diseases and conditions that affect the jaws, teeth, and mouth can impair speech. Some conditions that affect speech are present at birth (such as inborn muscular conditions and congenital anatomical abnormalities), while others are the result of metabolic diseases, infections, tumors, or injury. Abnormalities of the vocal cords such as inflammation, polyps, cysts, and tumors can affect the pitch and quality of the voice.
 
Dilated Pupils (Mydriasis)**************************************************

Dilation, or widening, of the pupils of the eyes is normal in conditions of low light in order to allow more light to reach the retina. Medically, dilation of the pupils is known as mydriasis. Specific medications known as mydriatics are administered to dilate the pupils for ophthalmologic examination. If the pupils are dilated due to an abnormal response, they may remain dilated even in the presence of sunlight or strong light. Injury to the brain and taking certain drugs are common causes of abnormally dilated pupils. Both medications and 
drugs of abuse can result in dilated pupils. Dilation of the pupil on one side only is also abnormal and may signal a 
brain injury or other condition that raises the pressure within the cranial cavity (increased intracranial pressure). 

 
Self-Neglect**************************************************

Self-neglect implies the inability or unwillingness to attend to one's personal needs or hygiene. It may manifest in different ways, such as not attending to one's nutrition, hygiene, clothing, or acting appropriately to care for medical conditions. Self-neglect can occur as a result of dementia, brain damage, or mental illnesses like depression or psychotic disorders. Some people who suffer from self-neglect may engage in unhealthy behaviors such as 
substance use or abuse, 
tobacco use, promiscuity, or inappropriate use of prescription medications. The list of conditions associated with self-neglect is very broad, and treatment options depend upon the precise cause of self-neglect. Antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are used when certain mental illnesses are the cause. Extreme self-neglect has been referred to as Diogenes syndrome.

 
Penile Discharge**************************************************

Penile discharge may be watery (clear) or cloudy (containing pus). The discharge may also be bloody. Urinary tract infection (UTI) or a sexually transmitted infection are common causes of penile discharge. Penile discharge is often accompanied by pain or burning during urination and a need to urinate frequently. Itching can also accompany penile discharge. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and
Trichomonas infections are common infections that may cause penile discharge.  Genital herpes rarely causes penile discharge.

 
Distended Stomach (Abdominal Distention)**************************************************

A distended stomach is a term usually used to refer to distension or swelling of the abdomen and not of the stomach itself. When the term is used in this manner, a number of different diseases and conditions can cause 
abdominal distension. These conditions can be related to digestion, such as malabsorption or lactose intolerance, or to disturbances in bowel function, such as irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS) or constipation. Bloating is another term that is sometimes used to refer to 
a swollen belly. Consumption of high-fiber foods can lead to intestinal gas and bloating. Less commonly, ovarian cysts or other types of tumors can cause the appearance of a distended abdomen. The accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, known as ascites, can cause the appearance of distension. Ascites has a number of causes, including cirrhosis of the liver.
 
Distractibility**************************************************

Distractibility is the state of being easily distracted, that is, having one's attention diverted from the task or thought at hand and turning to another unrelated thought or activity. Distractibility likely occurs due an inability to filter out outside stimuli such as noises or internal thoughts when trying to concentrate. Distractibility can occur in normal individuals who are tired or sleep-deprived, and it is also a symptom of certain medical conditions such as 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
Substance abuse and withdrawal can also cause distractibility, and it can be a feature of mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Distractibility is a very nonspecific symptom and is not always related to a disease or illness.
 
Diverticulitis**************************************************

Diverticula are small bulging sacs that protrude from the wall of the large intestine; when one of these diverticula ruptures, inflammation and infection occur in the affected area, resulting in the condition known as diverticulitis. Symptoms of diverticulitis include abdominal pain, fever, abdominal tenderness, constipation, and sometimes diarrhea. The abdominal pain is most common in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating or distension, and flatulence.

 
Dizziness**************************************************
Dizziness is a feeling of being lightheaded or woozy. Disturbances of 
the brain, gastrointestinal system, vision, and the vestibular system of the inner 
ear are known causes of dizziness. People often refer to dizziness as vertigo, 
unsteadiness, or lightheadedness.
 
Double Vision**************************************************

Double vision, or "seeing double," occurs when two nonmatching images are sent to the part of the brain that is responsible for processing visual input. If this occurs over the long term, the brain will eventually compensate for the two signals by suppressing one signal, so that a single image is perceived.  The suppressed eye may eventually become 
amblyopic ("lazy eye") with resultant vision loss.
 
Drainage of Pus**************************************************

 Drainage of pus is a typical consequence of a bacterial infection. Bacterial infection can either be localized, such as an infection of a small 
cut or wound in the skin, or it may spread to involve larger areas of the body. A number of different infections can cause small bumps or nodules that may drain pus. Infections of the genital tract or
urinary tract may cause drainage of pus in the urine or vagina in women. When bacteria enter the bloodstream, a potentially life-threatening condition known as sepsis ("blood poisoning") is the result. In addition to drainage of pus, other signs of a bacterial infection include
 
Drooling**************************************************

Drooling is the unintentional spillage of saliva from the mouth. Drooling can occur with any condition that impairs neuromuscular control of the muscles around the mouth, leading to weak muscles around the mouth, that increases salivation (the production of saliva), or that impairs swallowing. Cerebral palsy is one example of a condition in which oral neuromuscular control may be impaired, resulting in drooling. Other medical conditions that may cause drooling because of swallowing problems include Down syndrome, autism, ALS, stroke, and Parkinson's disease.
 
Dry Eyes**************************************************
Dryness of the eyes can be a normal response to weather 
or medications. Dryness of the eyes can also result from temporary or chronic 
health conditions. The tears of the of eye come from the tear gland, called the 
lacrimal gland, which is located above the outer eye. Tears are composed of 
water, oil, and antibodies. The moisture from tears on the front of the eye, the 
cornea, is important to avoid damage of the cornea.
 
Dry Mouth**************************************************
The uncomfortable feeling of dryness of the mouth can be annoying. Dry mouth can also lead to dental problems and infections of the mouth. Many products are now available
over-the-counter as well as by prescription for the relief of chronic mouth dryness and prevention of its complications. Professional dental care is essential for optimal oral health.
 
Dry Skin**************************************************
Dry skin, medically known as xerosis or xeroderma, is usually a mild condition caused by environmental factors, although dry skin can also result from some common skin ailments. Inherited diseases of the skin known as ichthyoses, while very rare, can also cause disfiguration and excessively dry skin. Even systemic conditions (conditions that affect the entire body) can lead to dry skin. One example is hypothyroidism, which reduces the activity of the glands that produce skin secretions. Some medications, including retinoids for the skin as well as some antihistamines and diuretics, may have dry skin as a side effect.
 
Dysarthria**************************************************

Dysarthria is a condition in which there is poor control or loss of control of the muscles used in speech, resulting in slurred or unintelligible speech. Speech may also be unusually slow in people with dysarthria. Drooling and problems with eating are often associated with dysarthria. The symptoms of dysarthria vary from person to person and are dependent upon the underlying cause of the condition and its severity. Disorders of the brain and nervous system and injuries to the brain are common causes of dysarthria, including stroke or brain tumors. Other causes are conditions that affect the muscles of the face or tongue directly. Some kinds of medications may also lead to dysarthria as a side effect, such as antiseizure medications or narcotic pain medications.
 
Indigestion (Dyspepsia, Upset Stomach)**************************************************
Dyspepsia is a disorder in which there may be symptoms of upper abdominal pain (above the navel), 
belching, nausea (with or without vomiting), 
abdominal bloating (the sensation of abdominal fullness without objective distention), early satiety (the sensation of fullness after a very small amount of food), and, possibly, abdominal distention (swelling). Symptoms of dyspepsia originate from the upper gastrointestinal tract, primarily the stomach and first part of the small intestine. 
The symptoms most often are provoked by eating, which is a time when many different gastrointestinal functions are called upon to work in concert. If function is not normal, the symptoms of dyspepsia occur.



 
Dysphagia**************************************************

Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. When dysphagia is mild, it may cause an individual only to stop eating for a minute or less, but when it is severe, it can prevent an individual from taking in enough calories for adequate nutrition. Dysphagia has many causes.  First, there may be physical (anatomical) obstruction to the passage of food.  Second, there may be abnormalities in the function of the nerves of the brain, throat, and esophagus whose normal function is necessary to coordinate swallowing.  Finally, there also may be abnormalities of the muscles of the throat and esophagus themselves.
 
E. coli 0157:H7 (Escherichia coli 0157:H7)**************************************************

E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a type of bacteria that commonly lives in the human intestine of healthy people. However, there are some strains of the bacteria that cause disease. The type of E. coli that normally reside in the intestine can cause disease if they spread outside the intestine 
(for example, spread into the urinary tract can cause urinary tract infection [UTI]). Other types of E. coli strains (enterovirulent E. coli strains or EEC) cause "poisoning" or diarrhea though they usually remain within the intestine by producing toxins or intestinal inflammation.

Earache**************************************************
Pain in the ear can occur because of conditions within the ear, the ear canal, or affecting the visible portion of the ear (the pinna). Acute middle ear infection, medically called acute
otitis media, is inflammation of the middle ear and is the most frequent diagnosis in sick children in the U.S. The eustachian tube is shorter in children than adults which allows easy entry of bacteria and viruses into the middle ear, resulting in acute otitis media.
 
Bruises**************************************************

A bruise is a traumatic injury of the soft tissues that results in breakage of the local capillaries and leakage of red blood cells. In the skin, bruising can be seen as a reddish-purple discoloration that does not blanch when pressed upon. This discoloration leads to the classic "black and blue" appearance. When a bruise fades, it becomes green and brown as the body metabolizes the blood cells and bilirubin pigment in the skin. A bruise can sometimes be associated with a temporary raised area in the skin and is usually associated with some tenderness. A bruise is best treated with local application of a cold pack immediately after injury.
 
Ebola Virus Disease**************************************************

Ebola virus is one of a group of viruses that cause a hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Symptoms of Ebola virus infection are similar to those produced by other hemorrhagic fever viruses and include fever, fatigue, malaise, reddened eyes, weakness, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patients experience a loss of appetite and often stomach pains. Some patients experience sore throat, rash, cough, hiccups, chest pain, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing. Later, as the disease progresses and worsens in severity, symptoms can include bleeding at various sites within or outside of the body.

Elbow Pain**************************************************
Elbow pain is most often the result of 
tendinitis, which can affect the inner or outer elbow. Treatment includes ice, rest, and medication for inflammation. Elbow pain has many other causes including trauma,
arthritis, and bursitis. Funny bone sensation is irritation of a nerve at the elbow that causes numbness and tingling of the inner elbow, forearm as well as little and ring fingers. Bacteria can infect the skin of a scraped (abraded) elbow to cause pain.


 
Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)**************************************************

Hyperglycemia is the term that refers to an abnormally high level of sugar, or glucose, in the blood. Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 are by far the most common causes of hyperglycemia. In patients with either 
type 1 or type 2 diabetes, metabolic abnormalities lead to an elevation in blood glucose levels. When there is too much glucose in the blood, this can lead to a number of health risks and other symptoms. The main symptoms associated with hyperglycemia are
 
Inability to Regulate Emotions**************************************************

The inability to regulate emotions can be a feature of psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other mental-health conditions. People suffering from psychosis may have an altered perception of reality that may affect their regulation of emotions, and those suffering from bipolar disorder or depression may also report a loss of control over their emotions. Problems controlling emotions can also occur in relation to brain damage or disorders. These symptoms can be accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms or physical symptoms if they are related to a medical condition.  The inability to regulate emotions is common in young children, but when present to an extreme degree, it may indicate an abnormality such as an emotional or behavior disorder.
 
Endocarditis**************************************************

Endocarditis, an inflammation of the valves of the heart, causes symptoms that can be nonspecific and similar to those of many other conditions. For example, fever, malaise, weakness, and shortness of breath are common symptoms of endocarditis. Other symptoms that can occur with endocarditis are chills, night sweats, fatigue, joint and muscle aches, and swelling of the legs, abdomen, and feet due to fluid accumulation (edema). Depending upon the cause of the endocarditis, other symptoms can occur. These include nausea, vomiting, blood in the urine, headaches, cough, pale skin, and painful red-purplish bumps under the skin of the fingers and toes known as Osler's nodes. Tiny hemorrhages known as petechiae can appear in the whites of the eyes, on the skin, or inside the mouth.

 
Enlarged Heart**************************************************
An enlarged heart is medically known as cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly can be 
caused by a number of different conditions, including diseases of the heart 
muscle or heart valves, high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and 
pulmonary 
hypertension. Cardiomegaly can also sometimes accompany longstanding anemia and 
thyroid diseases, among other conditions. So-called infiltrative diseases of the heart, 
for example, in which abnormal proteins (amyloidosis) or excess iron 
(hemochromatosis) accumulate within the tissues of the heart, can also cause an 
enlargement of the heart. Infections, nutritional deficiencies, toxins (such as 
alcohol or drugs), and some medications have been associated with cardiomegaly. 
In some situations (for example, pregnancy), there can be a temporary increased 
demand on the heart, resulting in some temporary enlargement.

Enterovirus (Non-Polio Enterovirus Infection)**************************************************

Many people who become infected with non-polio enteroviruses either have no symptoms from the infection or experience only a mild illness. When symptoms do occur, they often resemble those of the common cold: fever, malaise, cough, and runny nose. More serious infections can cause wheezing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, reddened skin, or cyanosis (a bluish tinge to the skin).
 
Enthesitis**************************************************

Enthesitis is inflammation of the entheses, the specific point where tendons or ligaments attach to bone. Enthesitis causes 
symptoms like

Euphoria**************************************************

Euphoria can be described as a heightened, exaggerated, or extremely positive sense of happiness or well-being. It is considered to represent an abnormally extreme degree of happiness or contentment beyond that which occurs in normal emotional responses. It can be described as a sense of intense joy or happiness that is beyond what would be expected under the normal circumstances. Euphoria may be experienced by those who suffer from bipolar depression (manic depression) in the manic phase. It may occasionally be seen in other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, in which emotional responses and perceptions of reality are abnormal. Euphoria in the context of a psychiatric condition can  also be accompanied by symptoms like

More serious infections can cause wheezing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, reddened skin, or cyanosis (a bluish tinge to the skin).
 
Excessive Sweating (Hyperhidrosis)**************************************************

Sweating is the act of secreting fluid from the skin by the sweat (sudoriferous) glands. These are small tubular glands situated within and under the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue). They discharge by tiny openings in the surface of the skin. Sweating is a normal response that helps regulate body temperature. People sweat more when it's hot outside or when they exercise. Increased sweating can also occur due to emotional states such as anger, fear, nervousness, or embarrassment.
 
Yawning**************************************************

Yawning is the involuntary opening of the mouth while taking in a long breath of air. Yawning is associated with sleepiness or drowsiness. Almost anything that causes drowsiness, ranging from tiredness to certain medications, can lead to yawning. Conditions like sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome can cause yawning due to daytime sleepiness. Excessive yawning is yawning that occurs beyond the amount expected even for someone who is sleepy. A vasovagal reaction is a process in the body that can trigger yawning. It can be caused by a heart attack or aortic dissection.
 
Swimmer's Ear (Otitis Externa)**************************************************

Otitis externa, sometimes known as swimmer's ear, is an inflammation or infection of the ear canal, the tube that leads from the eardrum to the outer ear. The term "swimmer's ear" is used because this infection often occurs in people who have been swimming or in the water. In addition to 
ear pain, symptoms can include
 
Eye Discharge**************************************************

Eye discharge occurs whenever there is excess fluid in the eye. Eye discharge may be clear and watery, like tears, or in the case of infections, it may be thick and opaque. There are many causes of eye discharge, ranging from infections to allergic reactions to eye injury. Irritation of the eyes is a frequent cause of watery eye discharge. Allergic reactions can cause itchy, watery eyes. Both allergies and infections cause pinkeye, or conjunctivitis. Eye discharge associated with infections is usually accompanied by other symptoms including 
redness (bloodshot appearance), burning, blurred vision, or eye pain. Photophobia (sensitivity to light) can be associated with eye infections. Most causes of eye discharge are not serious and can be easily treated. Eye discharge can be accompanied by other symptoms, including crust, matting of the eyelids, or tenderness.
 
Eye Pain**************************************************
The eye is the organ of sight. Eye pain can be cause by 
conditions involving the eyeball (orbit) or be caused by conditions of structures around the eye.

The cornea is the clear front window of the eye that
transmits and focuses light into the eye.
The iris is the colored part of the eye that helps regulate the amount of light that enters the eye.
The pupil is the dark aperture in the iris that determines how much light is let into the eye.
The lens is the transparent structure inside the eye that
focuses light rays onto the retina.
The retina is the nerve layer that lines the back of the 
eye, senses light and creates impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain.
The macula is a small area in the retina that contains
special light-sensitive cells and allows us to see fine details
clearly.
The optic nerve is the nerve that connects the eye to 
the brain and carries the impulses formed by the retina to the visual cortex of the brain.
The choroid is a thin vascular layer between the sclera 
 and the retina that supplies blood to the retina and conducts arteries and nerves to other structures in the eye.
The vitreous humor is a clear, jelly-like substance that
fills the middle of the eye.
None

 
Eye Twitch**************************************************
An eye twitch is an involuntary spasm of the muscles in the eyelid. Blepharospasm is the medical term for eyelid twitching. Eyelid twitching usually occurs every few seconds and lasts for a few minutes. It may come and go over a period of days or weeks. Sometimes the twitching results in the eye being held closed until the movement stops, but this is not always the case.
 
Fainting (Syncope)**************************************************
Fainting (syncope) is the partial or complete loss of 
consciousness with interruption of awareness of oneself and ones 
surroundings. When the loss of consciousness is temporary and there 
is spontaneous recovery, it is referred to as syncope or, in 
nonmedical terms, fainting. Syncope accounts for one in every 30 
visits to an emergency room. It is pronounced sin-ko-pea.

Fatigue, Tiredness, and Lethargy**************************************************
Tiredness is not a symptom that defines any one particular disease. Rather, tiredness can be a symptom of many different diseases and conditions. Causes of tiredness range from lack of
sleep and over exercise to medical and surgical treatments. The lack of energy 
(lethargy) associated
with tiredness can sometimes cause difficulty with normal daily activities, leading to problems with attentiveness and concentration.
 
Fecal Incontinence**************************************************

Fecal incontinence refers to the inability to hold feces (stool) in the rectum. This is typically due to failure of voluntary control over the anal sphincters, permitting untimely passage of feces and gas. Fecal incontinence is also known as rectal incontinence or bowel incontinence. Fecal incontinence is not a disease itself but is a symptom that can occur as a result of different kinds of diseases or injuries. Incontinence of stool can result from damage to the nerves or muscles of the rectum and anus, or conditions affecting the intestines. Overflow incontinence, also known as paradoxical diarrhea, occurs in people with chronic constipation when stool fills the rectum, hardens, and becomes impacted. Liquid stool then may leak around the fecal mass, producing symptoms similar to incontinence.

 
Fever**************************************************
Fever is considered a temperature above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees 
C). A feverish sensation, however, may occur when the body 
temperature is above the average normal of 98.6 degrees F. (37 degrees C).  None
 
Zika Virus Infection**************************************************

The Zika virus is transmitted to humans by the 
bite of a mosquito that carries the virus. When it causes symptoms (in about 
one out of every five infections), it typically produces a disease that lasts a few days to a week. Common Zika fever symptoms 
and signs include
 
Fibromyalgia**************************************************

The main symptom of fibromyalgia is pain that is believed to derive from an increased sensitivity to pain stimuli. The pain can be brought on by different situations, including noises, weather changes, or stress, but it may also occur without any relation to external events. The characteristic pain usually affects the neck, buttocks, shoulders, arms, upper back, and chest. "Tender points" are localized areas of the body that are tender to light touch. The tender points of fibromyalgia are commonly located around the elbows, shoulders, knees, hips, back of the head, and the sides of the breastbone.
 
Finger Pain**************************************************
Finger pain can be caused by disease or injury affecting any of the structures in the finger, including the bones, muscles, joints, tendons, blood vessels, or connective tissues. Joint pain is a feature of joint inflammation (arthritis) that may occur in the joints of the finger bones. This can sometimes be accompanied by redness, 
swelling, or warmth of the joints. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) commonly affect joints of the fingers. Trauma or injury to the finger, such as bruises, dislocations, and 
fractures of bone are all common causes of finger pain. Tumors of the structures in the finger are a very rare cause of finger pain. Certain conditions such as diabetes can cause damage to the nerves, resulting in pain, numbness, or 
tingling of the arms and legs. This phenomenon, known as peripheral neuropathy, can also sometimes cause finger pain. Infection of the skin or other tissues of the finger is a less common cause of finger pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome initially causes numbness and tingling in the hand, but as it progresses, it may cause cramping or burning in the fingers.
 
Flaky Scalp**************************************************
The loss of skin cells from the scalp is a normal part 
of the life cycle of skin cells. However, excessive flaking of the scalp, or 
dandruff, is a common cosmetic problem experienced by millions of people. 
Dandruff is not contagious and is normally not a serious problem. Some cases of 
excessive dandruff accompanied by intense itching and patches of flaky skin on the 
face or elsewhere are actually a form of eczema referred to as seborrheic 
eczema. 
 
Flat Affect**************************************************

A flat affect is the loss or lack of emotional responses to a situation or event that would typically elicit emotion. People with flat affect may appear to be completely unemotional or apathetic. Other associated symptoms include speaking in a monotone voice and a reduction in facial expressions. A flat affect is sometimes referred to as a blunted affect, although a blunted affect often refers to a reduction in emotions that is not as severe as that seen with flat affect. Flat affect can occur in association with schizophrenia or in some types of depression. 
 
Flu (Influenza)**************************************************
The flu 
(influenza) is a viral disease of the respiratory tract. Characteristic symptoms are
 
Mood Swings**************************************************

Mood swings refer to rapid changes in mood. The term may refer to minor daily mood changes or to significant mood changes as seen with mood disorders such as major depression or bipolar depression. Mood swings can also occur in women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The menopausal transition, specifically the time around approaching menopause or perimenopause, is associated with mood swings in some women. Mood swings can be seen with other conditions as well, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dementia, and thyroid conditions.
 
Foot Pain**************************************************
Pain in the foot can involve any part of the foot. Abnormalities of the skin, nerves, bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the foot can result in foot pain. Evaluating the cause of foot pain can require an understanding of the anatomy and physiology of not only the foot, but also the ankle, lower extremity, and lower spine.
 
Foreign Body in the Eye**************************************************

A foreign body in the eye is anything that is lodged in any part of the eye.  Usually foreign bodies are metal, glass, or organic material (such as insects). Depending upon the size and type of material that gets into the eye, it may be a minor irritation or can cause serious medical consequences. Foreign bodies may cause bleeding into the eye. Bleeding into the whites of the eye is due to blood collection in or under the conjunctiva, the lining membranes of the eye.  Blood over the iris (colored part) of the eye is known as a hyphema. This is often a sign of a serious eye injury.

 
Frequent Urination**************************************************
Excessive urination, or urinary frequency, can be divided into subcategories. The first would be related to an increase in total volume of urine produces (also known as polyuria). Second, there can be dysfunction in voiding whereby there are problems with the storage and emptying of urine. Finally, there may be urinary incontinence in which there is involuntary loss of urine. Urinary frequency is often associated with other symptoms like painful urination (dysuria), blood in the urine (hematuria), or an urgent need to urinate when it is the result of a urinary tract infection. Frequent urination may be a symptom of diabetes or can result from medications, such as diuretics. If urinary frequency occurs at night, it may be referred to as nocturia (having to urinate at night). Many pregnant women also experienced an increased need to urinate.
 
Gallbladder Attack**************************************************

The symptoms of gallbladder attack result most commonly due to the presence of gallstones. Less common causes include tumors of the bile duct or gallbladder or certain illnesses. With blockage to the flow of bile, the bile accumulates in the gallbladder, causing an increase in pressure that can sometimes lead to rupture. Symptoms of a gallbladder attack include pain in the upper right side or middle of the abdomen. The pain may be dull, sharp, or cramping. The pain typically starts suddenly. It is steady and may spread to the back or the area below the right shoulder blade. Having steady pain particularly after meals is a common symptom of gallbladder stones. Movement does not make the pain worsen.
 
Intestinal Gas**************************************************
Gas or 
"intestinal gas" means different things to different people.  Everyone has gas and eliminates it by belching or passing it through the rectum, medically referred to as flatulence (slang, farting).None

Excessive air in the stomach is not the only cause of belching. For some people, belching becomes a habit and does not reflect the amount of air in their stomachs. For others, belching is a response to any type of abdominal discomfort and not just to discomfort due to increased gas.

Gastritis**************************************************

Gastritis, or inflammation of the lining tissues of the stomach, can be either acute (coming on suddenly) or chronic (causing symptoms over a long period of time). Symptoms include upper abdominal, or epigastric pain, and burning and heartburn. The pain may get worse with eating. Nausea and vomiting sometimes occur along with the pain. Symptoms of chronic gastritis include feelings of fullness, nausea, flatulence, weight loss, and vomiting. Bloating, belching, and loss of appetite are other common symptoms. 

 
Gastroenteritis (Stomach Flu)**************************************************

Gastroenteritis, sometimes referred to as "stomach flu," is irritation and inflammation of the stomach and intestines. While viruses are common causes of gastroenteritis, the condition has nothing to do with the influenza virus, so the term 
None is a misnomer. Rotavirus and norovirus are the two most common types of virus that cause gastroenteritis. Bacterial infections can also cause the condition. Some bacterial causes of gastroenteritis include 
Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli. Less common causes of gastroenteritis are toxins, medication side effects, and heavy metals in drinking water. Symptoms of gastroenteritis typically include nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. If dehydration is present, 
signs and symptoms of dehydration, such as dry mouth, thirst, and dry skin, can occur. 
 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder**************************************************

Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder can vary in severity and may not be the same in all individuals suffering from anxiety. Common symptoms include restlessness, nervousness, worry, difficulty with concentration, feeling as if the mind is "blank," sleep disturbances, muscle tension, and fatigue. Anxiety symptoms can be associated with specific fears or phobias. There may be a tendency to avoid the object or situation that induces anxiety. Difficulty trusting others, startling easily, hypervigilance (excessive attention to staying safe), and nightmares are other possible symptoms. Severe symptoms are typical of those experienced in a panic attack and include palpitations, fast heart rate, chest pain, a sense of impending doom, shortness of breath, trembling, sweating palms, dizziness, feeling detached from oneself, nausea, and fear of losing control are all symptoms that may occur with a panic attack.
 
Genital Warts**************************************************

Genital warts are benign growths (lumps or bumps) on the genital areas. They are raised, flesh-colored bumps or lumps that may have a jagged or rough appearance. Itching and burning are common associated symptoms, but in many cases, there may be no symptoms except for the presence of the warts. They can occur in any location that is exposed during skin-to-skin sexual contact. Certain 
signs and symptoms, like vaginal discharge or bleeding, can occur if the warts are located in the vaginal opening in women.
 
Giardiasis (Giardia Lamblia Infection)**************************************************
Signs and symptoms of giardiasis can vary, and some people may be infected without showing any symptoms. Symptoms, when they occur, can last 
two weeks or longer. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, gas, fatty or foul-smelling stools (they may float), and stomach or abdominal cramping. Nausea and vomiting may occur along with malaise, fatigue, and bloating. The symptoms together can lead to dehydration. Less common symptoms may include itching of the skin, hives, joint swelling, and swollen eyes. If 
untreated, the infection can persist for months to years. Over time, giardiasis can cause weight loss, malnutrition, and delayed development in children. 

 
Gum Disease**************************************************

Gum disease is inflammation of the gums. Gum disease can also be referred to as periodontal (around the teeth) disease, periodontitis (inflammation of areas around the teeth), and gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). Gingivitis and periodontitis are two different types of gum disease that vary in severity. Mild gum disease (gingivitis) simply causes redness or occasional bleeding during toothbrushing. In more serious cases of gum disease, there is damage to the soft tissues and bones that support the teeth (periodontitis), leading to separation of the teeth from the gums. The separated areas, or pockets, easily become irritated and inflamed. Severe cases of gum disease can result in tooth loss.
 
Gout**************************************************

Symptoms of gout arise from the deposition of uric acid crystals within joints. This leads to the typical symptoms of arthritis, such as joint pain, joint swelling, sensitivity to touch, warmth, and redness. The joint pain of gout is typically severe, and a common location is the joint of the big toe. In addition to deposition in the joints, uric acid crystals may be deposited in other tissues, leading to nodules known as tophi. Tophi are recognized as lumps under the skin and can occur in different locations in the body. Most commonly, tophi are found on the elbows, ears, and on the surfaces of joints.

 
Groin Pain**************************************************

The groin area is the area where the upper thigh meets the lower abdomen. Pain in the groin area arises from conditions affecting a variety of organs, including musculoskeletal pain or pain related to the male reproductive organs. Groin pain can be acute (sudden in onset), or the pain can persist over time (chronic), depending on the specific cause. As with any pain, the characteristics of groin pain 
-- its precise location, timing, duration, etc. -- are important to determine the cause. Groin pain can arise due to trauma or injury, tumors, infections, hernias, or other conditions. Pain in the groin can also originate in areas other than the groin, such as the leg. This is known as radiating or referred pain. For example, injury to the muscles or tendons in the leg can cause radiating pain to the groin area.
 
Gum Disease**************************************************

Gum disease is inflammation of the gums. Gum disease can also be referred to as periodontal (around the teeth) disease, periodontitis (inflammation of areas around the teeth), and gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). Gingivitis and periodontitis are two different types of gum disease that vary in severity. Mild gum disease (gingivitis) simply causes redness or occasional bleeding during toothbrushing. In more serious cases of gum disease, there is damage to the soft tissues and bones that support the teeth (periodontitis), leading to separation of the teeth from the gums. The separated areas, or pockets, easily become irritated and inflamed. Severe cases of gum disease can result in tooth loss.
 
Hair Loss**************************************************
There are many types of alopecia (baldness or hair loss), each with a different cause. Alopecia may be localized to the front and top of the head, as in common male pattern baldness. It may be patchy, as in a condition called alopecia areata. Or it can involve the entire head, as in alopecia capitis totalis (also called alopecia totalis), and it can involve hair loss of the entire body, such as in alopecia universalis. Alopecia can be caused by medications, such as from chemotherapy for cancer. It can also be a result of an underlying disease, such as with an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and systemic lupus erythematosus. Alopecia may have no symptoms other than the loss of hair, or it can be associated with itching and/or rash of the scalp.
 
Hairy Tongue**************************************************

Hairy tongue, medically known as lingua villosa, is generally a harmless condition that alters the appearance of the tongue, making it appear discolored and furry. Hairy tongue is also commonly referred to as black hairy tongue (lingua villosa nigra), but the tongue discoloration may appear white, brown, pink, or green. The color of the tongue depends both on the underlying condition plus the presence of any additional factors, such as the type of food consumed. Hairy tongue is caused by irritation of the surface of the tongue, leading to the elongation of the papillae that are normally present on the surface of the tongue along with an absence of shedding of superficial cells that is typically facilitated by toothbrushing or dietary factors. A number of different conditions can 
cause the development of hairy tongue.
 
Hallucinations**************************************************

Hallucinations are sensations that appear to be real but are created within the mind. Examples include seeing things that are not there, hearing voices or other sounds, experiencing body sensations like crawling feelings on the skin, or smelling odors that are not there. Hallucinations can be a feature of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and are also very common in drug-induced states and in drug withdrawal. This occurs with a number of different drugs. People who are seriously ill, such as those with liver 
failure or kidney failure, can experience hallucinations. High fevers can also produce hallucinations in some people. Hallucinations can accompany other psychotic symptoms such as delusions and disconnection from reality. They can be temporary or persist over the long term, depending upon the exact type of hallucinations and their cause.
 
Hand Pain**************************************************
Hand pain can be caused by disease or injury affecting any of the structures in the hand, including the bones, muscles, joints, tendons, blood vessels, or connective tissues. Hand pain is one feature of joint inflammation (arthritis) that may be felt in the hand. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are the two most common types of arthritis in the hand. 
Repetitive motion injuries, including carpal tunnel syndrome, can cause 
pain in the wrist and hand. Tumors of the structures in the hand are a very rare cause of hand or finger pain. Certain conditions such as diabetes can cause damage to the nerves, resulting in pain, numbness, or 
tingling of the arms and legs. This phenomenon, known as peripheral neuropathy, can also sometimes cause hand pain. 
DeQuervain's disease is a swelling and inflammation of the tendon around the thumb, causing pain in the thumb and lower arm. Trauma or injury to any of the structures in the hand is another common cause of hand pain.
 
Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**************************************************

The symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease are typically mild and occur mainly in children during the spring and fall seasons. Symptoms can include fever, malaise, decreased appetite, and sore throat. A rash is characteristic of this viral disease. The rash of hand, foot, and mouth disease is most commonly observed on the palms, soles of the feet, and inside the mouth. The rash sometimes spreads to the lower calves and buttocks. The small red bumps quickly develop into blisters. The sores inside the mouth are typically painful.

 
Headache**************************************************

A headache (medically termed cephalgia) is a pain in the head. Headaches can be located anywhere in the head, including above the eyes or the ears, behind the head (occipital headache), the 
top of the head (coronal headache), or in the back of the upper neck. Headache, 
like chest pain or 
backache, has many causes.
 
Hearing Loss**************************************************
Hearing loss can be present at birth (congenital) or become evident later in life (acquired deafness). The distinction between acquired and congenital deafness specifies only the time that the deafness appears. It does not specify whether the cause of the deafness is genetic (inherited).
None
 
Heart Attack in Women**************************************************

The classic symptoms of heart attack include a feeling of extreme pressure on the chest 
and chest pain, including a squeezing or full sensation. This can be accompanied by pain in one or both arms, jaw, 
back, stomach, or 
neck. Other symptoms of heart attack include shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, and a 
sweating feeling, often described as breaking out in a cold sweat. Although chest pain and pressure are the characteristic symptoms, women are somewhat more likely than men to experience heart attack that does not 
occur in this typical fashion. Instead, some women with heart attacks may experience more of the other symptoms, like lightheadedness, nausea, extreme fatigue, fainting, dizziness, or pressure in the upper back. Because of the absence of typical symptoms associated with heart attacks in men, many women who have heart attacks think the symptoms are due to another condition, like the flu or 
gastroesophageal reflux.

 
Heart Disease**************************************************

The term heart disease is very broad and includes a number of conditions, ranging from congenital (inborn) abnormalities of the heart to coronary artery disease caused by atherosclerosis. Sometimes the term is used synonymously with coronary artery disease, but in the true sense of the term, heart disease can apply to any number of conditions.
 
Heart Failure**************************************************
Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle is not able to function in a manner that can sufficiently supply the body with oxygen. Congestive heart failure is the failure of the heart muscle to maintain the circulation, leading to a backup of blood in the veins that causes swelling, particularly in the lower parts of the body. Shortness of breath is another common symptom of congestive heart failure that occurs due to fluid buildup in the lungs. Fatigue and a decreased capacity to exercise are other symptoms that commonly result from heart failure. Early symptoms and signs may not be apparent, and symptoms may develop only after the condition has progressed over time.
 
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**************************************************
Heartburn is an uncomfortable feeling of burning and warmth behind the breastbone (sternum) but sometimes rising as high as the neck. It usually occurs after meals, when lying down, or at night while sleeping.  Heartburn usually is due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the rise of stomach acid back up into the esophagus. Heartburn has nothing whatsoever to do with the heart though the discomfort of heartburn may be confused with heart pain and vice versa. Heartburn is a popular nonmedical term that often is referred to medically as pyrosis.
 
Heel Pain**************************************************
Pain in the heel can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities of the skin, nerves, bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the heel can all result in pain. Because of walking and daily movement, we are always at risk for injury or trauma to the heel area. Common causes of pain in the heel include blisters and corns. 
Plantar fasciitis, inflammation of the "bowstring-like" tissue in the sole of the foot stretching from the heel to the front of the foot, is one condition commonly associated with heel pain. Sometimes diseases that affect other areas of the body, like peripheral vascular disease or arthritis, can also result in pain in the foot or heel. 
Sever's disease is a cause of heel pain in children that results from injury to the growth plate of the heel bone. Treatments for heel pain depend on the particular cause.
 
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) Infection**************************************************

None infects the cells of the stomach lining, causing production of a toxin and subsequent inflammation that can lead to a variety of symptoms 
and signs. The clinical picture is very variable in that some people who are infected do not have any symptoms. Others may have mild symptoms, while others develop severe symptoms and ulcers.
 
Hemolysis**************************************************

Hemolysis is the destruction of red blood cells. Hemolysis can occur due to different causes and leads to the release of hemoglobin into the bloodstream. Normal red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a lifespan of about 120 days. After they die they break down and are removed from the circulation by the spleen. In some medical conditions, or as a result of taking certain medications, this breakdown of red blood cells is increased. Red cells may break down due to mechanical damage, such as from artificial heart valves or heart-lung bypass; or they may be destroyed due to defects in the cells themselves. Medications that have been associated with hemolysis include acetaminophen, penicillin, and other pain medications. 
None is the term used to refer to anemia caused by the excess destruction of red blood cells.

Hepatitis C (HCV)**************************************************

Most people do not have symptoms when they acquire the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, 
and about one-fourth of those infected will have symptoms like
 
Herpes**************************************************

Herpes viruses typically infect the oral or genital mucosa. When herpes affects the mouth, it causes the typical "cold sores," which are painful sores or blisters that form on the lips, mouth, or gums. Prior to the development of the blisters, there may be a prodrome (early symptoms indicating onset of a particular disease) consisting of an itching, burning, or tingling sensation in the affected area. The virus remains dormant in the nervous system throughout life, and this is the reason that cold sores often recur in the same location.
 
Hiatal Hernia**************************************************

Most hiatal hernias are of the so-called "sliding" type, in which the junction of the esophagus and stomach and part of the stomach protrude into the chest. The junction may reside permanently in the chest, but often it juts into the chest only during a swallow. These hernias can and most often do occur without producing symptoms at all. When they do produce symptoms, they are the typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Heartburn, regurgitation, and nausea are common symptoms. Other symptoms can include chest pain or burning and difficulty swallowing. A 
bloated feeling after meal consumption and shortness of breath sometimes occur.

 
Hiccups**************************************************

Hiccups is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm muscle that results in a characteristic cough-like "hic" sound due to closure of the vocal cords. Hiccups are common and can affect anyone. Eating or drinking too quickly is a common cause of hiccups. Sometimes a cause for hiccups cannot be identified. Any event that causes irritation to the diaphragm or the nerves that supply the diaphragm can cause hiccups. Medical causes such as nerve damage, stroke, and 
tumors are rare causes of hiccups. Babies may have hiccups after bouts of crying or coughing. Most cases of hiccups resolve on their own. Breath-holding and drinking a glass of water are common ways to stop hiccups. Medications are only given as treatment for severe and persistent hiccups that do not resolve.
 
High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**************************************************

High blood pressure, or hypertension, most commonly occurs without any symptoms and has for this reason been referred to as the "silent killer." Uncomplicated hypertension can persist for years, even decades, without causing symptoms. However, when complications of the condition begin to develop due to damage to the vascular system, symptoms can occur. Symptoms of complicated hypertension (high blood pressure) can include dizziness, shortness of breath, headache, and blurred vision. Other possible symptoms are 
nosebleeds,
blood in the urine, fatigue, chest pain, and a pounding sensation in the neck, chest, or ears.
 
Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)**************************************************

Hyperglycemia is the term that refers to an abnormally high level of sugar, or glucose, in the blood. Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 are by far the most common causes of hyperglycemia. In patients with either 
type 1 or type 2 diabetes, metabolic abnormalities lead to an elevation in blood glucose levels. When there is too much glucose in the blood, this can lead to a number of health risks and other symptoms. The main symptoms associated with hyperglycemia are
 
Hip Pain**************************************************

Pain in the hip can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities of the skin, nerves, bones, joints, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the hip can all result in pain. Sometimes diseases that affect other joints in the body, such as the inflammation resulting from arthritis, can be the cause of pain in the hip. Trauma or injury, including bone 
fracture, is also a cause of hip pain. Pain in the hip area may also originate from painful infections or other conditions of the skin, such as shingles. Hip pain may also occur because of a problem with the back or spine. Depending upon the cause of hip pain, the pain may occur when walking, running, or engaging in activity. Bursitis of one of the two bursae of the hip (sacs that provide cushioning between bones and tissues) can cause hip pain. Trochanteric bursitis is the most common type of hip bursitis and causes pain at the point of the hip. Treatments for hip pain depend on the underlying cause.
 
HIV Infection**************************************************
Most symptoms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection do not appear 
until an individual has begun to experience the immune deficiency that develops 
after a long-term infection. This typically happens many years after an initial 
infection with the virus. On average, the symptoms of immune deficiency appear 
eight to 10 years after viral infection, but they may not appear for even longer time 
periods. 
 
Hoarseness**************************************************
Hoarseness is a harsh, rough, 
raspy quality to the voice. 
Hoarseness is generally caused by irritation of, or injury to, the vocal cords. This trauma to the vocal cords leads to a change in the pitch of the voice. The voice box, or larynx, is the portion of the respiratory (breathing) tract 
containing the vocal cords that produce sound. It is located between the 
pharynx and the trachea. The larynx, also called the voice box, is a 
2-inch-long, tube-shaped organ in the neck.
 
Hot Flashes**************************************************
A hot flash is a feeling of warmth spreading over the body that is often most strongly felt in the head and neck regions. Hot flashes may be accompanied by perspiration or flushing and usually last from 30 seconds to several minutes. Although hot flashes are a characteristic symptom of perimenopause, rare tumors, and other medical conditions may sometimes also cause hot flashes. Taking certain medications, eating spicy foods, and the consumption of 
alcohol have also been associated with the occurrence of hot flashes.
 
Hyperactivity**************************************************

Hyperactivity is a state of excess activity that may be manifested by symptoms such as
 
Hyperthermia**************************************************
Symptoms of hyperthermia, or heat-related illness, vary according to the specific type of illness. The most severe form of hyperthermia is heat stroke. This happens when the body is no longer able to regulate its internal temperature; 
this is a medical emergency. The body temperature may be over 105 F, a level that damages the brain and other organs. Other symptoms include muscle cramps, fatigue, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. The heart rate may be elevated, and the skin is reddened. The skin may be moist if sweating is still occurring, or it may be dry if sweating has stopped. Confusion and mental changes may develop, and 
seizures can occur with brain damage. Ultimately, coma and death may ensue.
 
Hyperthyroidism**************************************************

Symptoms of hyperthyroidism arise from the elevated levels of thyroid hormones produced by the overactive thyroid gland. Excessive intake of thyroid hormones can produce these symptoms as well. Characteristic symptoms include a rapid heart rate, excessive sweating, intolerance to heat, tremor, nervousness, or agitation. Other symptoms can include fatigue, weight loss, hair loss, increased appetite, problems with concentration, frequent bowel movements, and irregular or decreased menstrual blood flow in women. Sometimes, thyroid nodules or an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) are apparent. With severe hyperthyroidism, cardiac arrhythmias, fever, high blood pressure, and heart failure can develop. 

 
Hyperventilation**************************************************
Hyperventilation refers to overbreathing, in which 
ventilation exceeds the 
 metabolic demand, and 
its related physiological consequences. Excessive breathing can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, 
 weakness, shortness of breath, a sense of unsteadiness, 
muscle 
spasms in the hands and feet, and a tingling feeling around the mouth and fingertips. All of these symptoms are the result of 
abnormally low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood caused by overbreathing.

 
Hypocalcemia**************************************************

Symptoms of hypocalcemia arise from lower than normal levels of calcium in the blood. Some affected people, especially if the condition is mild, will not have symptoms. Others may have severe and life-threatening symptoms. Symptoms include
 
Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)**************************************************
Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) means that blood levels of glucose are too low. This condition is most commonly a complication of treatment for diabetes. Symptoms of hypoglycemia vary among people. When blood sugar levels drop, symptoms can include
 
Hypopituitarism**************************************************

The symptoms of hypopituitarism result from decreased hormone production by the pituitary gland. When all the pituitary hormones are affected, the condition is known as panhypopituitarism. Isolated or partial hypopituitarism results when the production of one or more hormones is decreased. The symptoms are variable and depend on the severity of the condition and the number of hormones that are affected. Symptoms can include anemia, decreased appetite, weight loss or gain, sensitivity to cold, fatigue, and a decreased sex drive. Women may experience irregular menstrual cycles, loss of menstruation (amenorrhea), infertility, and the inability to produce milk. Infertility can affect males, as well as a reduction in hair on the face or body. Hypopituitarism in children can lead to short stature and delayed growth and development. Other symptoms include weakness, headache, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, vision problems, facial swelling, hoarseness, joint stiffness, and loss of pubic or armpit hair.
 
Hypothermia**************************************************
In hypothermia, the body temperature is dangerously low (below 95 F or 35 C), and the body has lost capacity to regulate its temperature. The symptoms typically begin gradually, and eventually, thought process and brain function are affected. Symptoms include shivering, slow breathing, weak and slow pulse, and drowsiness. Mood changes, irritability, poor coordination, confusion, poor judgment, slurred speech, and gait disturbances are common. Sometimes affected people remove their clothing in spite of a cold environment (paradoxical undressing). There is a progressive decrease in consciousness, and coma may ensue.

 
Hypothyroidism**************************************************

Symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism may be subtle and nonspecific, so they may not always clearly signal a thyroid problem. Sometimes, the patient may not notice specific symptoms related to hypothyroidism. Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, depression, mild weight gain, cold intolerance, sleepiness, and constipation. Other symptoms can include dry and coarse hair, dry skin, and muscle cramps. Blood cholesterol levels may be elevated. Patients with hypothyroidism may also report aches and pains, swelling in the legs, and difficulty concentrating. Menstrual dysfunction, hair loss, decreased sweating, decreased appetite, mood changes, blurred vision, and hearing impairment are also possible symptoms. Later symptoms (when the condition worsens) can include puffiness around the eyes, slow heart rate, lowered body temperature, and heart failure.

 
Erectile Dysfunction (Impotence)**************************************************
Impotence is a common problem among men 
and is characterized by the consistent inability to sustain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse or the inability to achieve
ejaculation, or both. Erectile dysfunction can vary. It can involve a total inability to achieve an erection or ejaculation, an inconsistent ability to do so, or a tendency to sustain only very brief erections.
 
Impulsivity**************************************************

Impulsivity is the tendency to act on impulse -- that is, without forethought about the appropriateness or consequences of the action.  A certain degree of impulsivity is common in 
children and even some young adults often display impulsivity of behavior. Only when present to excess and accompanied by problems with normal function is impulsivity considered abnormal in young children. Impulsivity can be manifested in an action or in interrupting a discussion, blurting out answers, or the inability to wait one's turn at an activity. Impulsivity is often observed in those who suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can affect adults as well as children and teens. Impulsivity is often accompanied by symptoms such as restlessness, hyperactivity, inattention, problems doing quiet activities, problems with executive function, talking excessively, and fidgeting. Impulsivity can, less commonly, be related to medical problems that interfere with an individual's cognitive function, such as stroke or dementia.

 
Inability to Regulate Emotions**************************************************

The inability to regulate emotions can be a feature of psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other mental-health conditions. People suffering from psychosis may have an altered perception of reality that may affect their regulation of emotions, and those suffering from bipolar disorder or depression may also report a loss of control over their emotions. Problems controlling emotions can also occur in relation to brain damage or disorders. These symptoms can be accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms or physical symptoms if they are related to a medical condition.  The inability to regulate emotions is common in young children, but when present to an extreme degree, it may indicate an abnormality such as an emotional or behavior disorder.
 
Inattention**************************************************

Inattention is the lack of focus when focus on a given event or situation is required. Inattention is a hallmark feature of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can affect adults as well as children and teens. Inattention in ADHD is often accompanied by symptoms such as restlessness, problems doing quiet activities, problems with executive function, talking excessively, and fidgeting.  Inattention can also occur due to external factors such as distractions as well as situations of emotional stress, anxiety, conflict, anger, or other mood changes. Inattention can also be related to medical problems that interfere with an individual's cognitive function, such as stroke or dementia. Inattention can be seen in typical young children and  is classified as a disorder only when present to excess and accompanied by problems with normal function. Depression and related conditions can cause mood changes that may include lack of attention and interest in normal daily activities.
 
Urinary Incontinence**************************************************
Urinary incontinence is the unintentional loss of urine. Incontinence results from an inability to hold urine in the bladder due to loss of voluntary control over the muscles (urinary sphincters) around the opening of the urine tube (ureter).
 
Increased Appetite**************************************************

An increase in appetite can be a normal physiological response that occurs, for example, in children and adolescents during periods of growth or following strenuous activity or excessive caloric demand. In some cases, an increase in appetite can be a sign of an abnormal condition, such as some endocrinologic 
conditions, including diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and Graves' disease. Increased 
appetite may also be seen in certain emotional or psychiatric conditions, as 
well as a response to stress, anxiety, or depression. Episodes of hypoglycemia 
can cause excessive hunger as well. Certain prescription drugs can also increase 
appetite. It is important to take into account the context and any related 
emotional or physical factors when determining whether one has an abnormally 
increased appetite. Polyphagia is the medical term for excessive eating.
 
Infectious Mononucleosis (Mono)**************************************************

The symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (known as "mono") are nonspecific at the beginning. Lack of energy and fatigue are common initial complaints. These can be accompanied by a loss of appetite and chills. These early symptoms may last for a few days before more severe symptoms begin.
 
Infertility**************************************************
Infertility is the diminished ability or the inability to conceive and have
offspring. Infertility is also defined in specific terms as the failure to conceive after a year of regular intercourse without contraception.  Irreversible infertility is also referred to as sterility.


 
Laryngitis**************************************************

Laryngitis is inflammation of the voice box, or larynx, resulting in voice changes such as hoarseness or loss of the voice completely in some cases. It is most commonly due to an infection such as the common cold or flu and typically follows a period of experiencing a cough or sore throat. However, laryngitis can also develop in response to chronic irritation of the larynx. For example, some conditions like gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), some cancers, chronic tonsillitis, and other conditions can lead to inflammation.  Voice overuse and irritants like cigarette smoke can also lead to irritation of the voice box and laryngitis.
 
Insomnia**************************************************
Insomnia is the perception of inadequate or poor-quality 
 sleep. It can be due to 
problems falling asleep, early wakening, waking frequently during the night, 
unrefreshing sleep, or a combination of these. Contrary to some popular beliefs, 
insomnia is not defined by the total amount of sleep one gets or how long it 
takes a person to fall asleep. Individuals can vary in their need for sleep, and 
in the time required to fall asleep. What is a refreshing night's sleep for one 
person might be insomnia for another person.
 
Insulin Resistance**************************************************

Insulin resistance means that the cells of the body have become resistant to the action of the hormone insulin. Insulin, secreted by the pancreas, is critical for the body's use of glucose for energy. When the cells of the body do not respond appropriately to insulin, glucose from the bloodstream cannot be taken up by cells and used for fuel. Consequently, the pancreas tries to compensate by producing even more insulin.  When the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels rise. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for the development of diabetes and its associated complications. Insulin resistance is a step in the development of type 2 diabetes and often occurs years before a person develops diabetes. Insulin resistance has been referred to as prediabetes.
 
Interstitial Cystitis**************************************************

Interstitial cystitis, sometimes referred to as painful bladder syndrome, is characterized by pelvic pain, urinary frequency (an increased need to urinate), and urinary urgency. Other signs and symptoms of interstitial cystitis are a decreased bladder capacity, feelings of pressure and tenderness around the bladder, and painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Men may experience discomfort in the penis and scrotum. Signs and symptoms can vary among affected people and may vary in severity. 

 
Inverted Nipple**************************************************

An inverted nipple is a condition in which the nipple is pulled inward into the breast instead of pointing outward. 
This condition can also be called nipple inversion, nipple retraction, or invaginated nipple, although some observers distinguish these two variations. Nipple retraction can be a congenital (present at birth) condition as a normal variant in some women. In other cases, it may arise as a result of disease or trauma. Any condition that causes inflammation or scarring of the tissues behind the nipple may cause the nipple to pull inward.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**************************************************
The main symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are
 
Itching**************************************************

Itching is a symptom we have all experienced.  Nevertheless, itching can be difficult 
for a person to describe to others. While itching symptoms vary, it typically leads to a peculiarly uncomfortable skin sensation. It may feel as if something is crawling on (or in) your skin. Itching can be diffuse (generalized all over the body) or localized -- all over or confined to a specific spot -- and there are many causes of diffuse and localized itching. Itching symptoms can be associated with
 
Jaundice**************************************************
Jaundice, also referred to as icterus, is the yellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) by abnormally high blood levels of the bile
pigment, bilirubin. The yellowing extends to other tissues and body fluids and also may turn the urine dark. Yellowing of only the skin also can be caused by eating too many carrots or drinking too much carrot juice. None

Jaw Pain**************************************************
The jaw joint, medically referred to as the temporomandibular joint or 
TMJ, 
is made up of the bone below the mouth (the mandible, commonly referred to as 
the jawbone) and the bone just above the mouth (the maxilla). 
The TMJ allows the upper jaw to close on the lower jaw and is one of the most 
frequently used joints of the body.
 
Joint Cracking (Joint Popping)**************************************************
The symptom of joint cracking is described differently by different people while nevertheless representing the same condition. Various descriptions for the same process include "popping," "exploding," "noise," "snapping," and "creaking" of a joint. The cause of joint cracking depends on a number of conditions. Situational information that is essential in detecting the cause of joint popping includes whether it a singular episode of sounds coming from the joint or if it is a repeatable, recurrent event.
 
Joint Deformity**************************************************

Joint deformity can have many different forms depending on the cause and the joint involved. The typical joint is an area where two bones join together. There is cartilage over the bones on each side of the joint. Ligaments bind the bones to give the joint stability. Surrounding the joint is a fluid-producing tissue called the synovium, and it is covered by a joint capsule. Tendons with their muscles and bursae are adjacent to joints and function in joint mobility. Deformity of the joint can occur with disease or injury to any of these structures of the joint. Diseases and injuries that cause joint deformity include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer of bone or cartilage, osteomyelitis, trauma from sports or motor vehicle accidents, and 
fractures.

 
Joint Pain**************************************************

Joint pain can be caused by injury affecting any of the ligaments, bursae, or 
tendons surrounding the joint. Injury can also affect the ligaments, cartilage, 
and bones within the joint. Pain is also a feature of joint inflammation 
(arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis) and infection, and 
extremely rarely it can be a cause of cancer of the joint. Pain within the joint is a common cause of shoulder pain, ankle pain, and knee pain. Joint pain is also referred to as arthralgia. The sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) 
chlamydia and 
gonorrhea can lead to joint pain.

Joint Redness**************************************************

Redness of the joints refers to redness of the skin surrounding a joint. It can often be accompanied by
 
Joint Stiffness**************************************************

Joint stiffness is the sensation of difficulty moving a joint or the apparent loss of range of motion of a joint. Joint stiffness often accompanies joint pain and/or 
swelling. Depending on the cause of joint stiffness, joint redness, tenderness, warmth, tingling, or numbness of an affected area of the body may be present. Joint stiffness can be caused by injury or disease of the joint and is a common finding in the arthritis conditions. Joint damage, including stiffness, can also occur following injury to the joint. Sometimes injuries or inflammation of the adjacent areas, such as bursae, can cause pain that may limit the movement of a joint and be perceived as joint stiffness. Joint pain is also referred to as arthralgia.
 
Joint Warmth**************************************************

Warmth of a joint occurs in many normal and abnormal settings. Joint warmth can be a result of a warm covering over a joint and be normal. Joint warmth is a normal part of the healing process after surgical replacement of joints (arthroplasty). Injury, including fracture, bruising, and bleeding into a joint, can lead to joint warmth. Joint warmth can also be a result of diseases of, or injury to, the joint that cause inflammation. These diseases and injuries include arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as infection directly or indirectly involving the joint, such as from bacteria or viruses and septic arthritis, Osgood-Schlatter disease, repetitive motion injuries, cellulitis, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, stress fracture, dislocated knee, sickle cell disease, sporotrichosis, abscess, obesity, osteochondritis desiccans, knee strain, rheumatic fever, torn meniscus, ACL injury, and patellofemoral pain syndrome.

 
Kawasaki Disease**************************************************

High fever is a prominent symptom in children with Kawasaki disease. The fever is persistent and lasts for at least 
five days. Nonspecific symptoms can precede or accompany the fever, including fussiness, nausea, vomiting, runny nose, cough, diarrhea, joint pain, abdominal pain, and decreased intake of food and liquids. Other signs and symptoms can include redness of the eyes, 
gum ulcers, cracked lips, reddening of the lining of the mouth, inflamed ("strawberry") tongue, and rash over the hands and feet. There can be swelling around the areas of the rash. 
Enlargement of the lymph nodes of the neck can be present.

 
Kidney Cancer**************************************************

Symptoms of kidney cancer include blood in the urine, giving the urine a rusty, pink, or dark red appearance. Persistent pain in the side (flank) is another common symptom, along with an abdominal mass or lump, fever, weight loss, tiredness, and a general feeling of being unwell. However, noncancerous conditions like 
cysts, benign tumors, or infections are the most common causes of these symptoms. Blood in the urine should always be investigated to determine the cause.

 
Kidney Infection (Pyelonephritis)**************************************************
A kidney infection is one of the many different types of infection of the urinary tract. A kidney infection, sometimes referred to as pyelonephritis, is an upper urinary tract infection, in contrast to infections of the bladder and urethra, which are considered to be lower urinary tract (closer to the site of urine output) infections. A kidney infection can occur when a lower urinary tract infection spreads upward in the urinary tract to involve the kidneys.
 
Kidney Stone**************************************************

A kidney stone does not usually cause symptoms when it remains in the kidney. However, when a stone moves from the kidney into the ureter, it can cause a blockage of flow of urine, increasing pressure and swelling within the kidney and leading to the symptoms of kidney stones.
 
Knee Pain**************************************************
Knee pain can be a result of injury or disease of the knee joint. Injury can affect any of the ligaments, bursae, or tendons surrounding the knee joint. Injury can also affect the ligaments, cartilage, menisci (plural for meniscus), and bones within the joint. The complexity of the design of the knee joint and the fact that it is an active weight-bearing joint are factors in making the knee one of the most commonly injured joints.
 
Swollen Knee**************************************************

A swollen knee is a common result of trauma or injury to the knee, such as sports-related injuries or automobile accidents. Falls and overuse injuries are another common cause of knee injury.
 
Koilonychia**************************************************

Spoon-shaped or spooning fingernails refers to a concavity in the fingernail itself, resulting in a depression in the nail that gives an appearance of a spoon shape to the entire nail. This growth disturbance in the nail is medically known as koilonychia. The spooning is typically such that a water droplet may be placed and held in the depression within the nail. This pattern can sometimes be seen in normal infants, but it disappears as the child ages. Koilonychia is a component of the nail-patella syndrome, a genetic disease characterized by numerous abnormalities including musculoskeletal and kidney abnormalities. Spooning fingernails can also result from trauma, exposure to certain solvents, or it may be associated with chronic medical conditions. In particular, koilonychias is associated with iron deficiency.
 
Inability to Regulate Emotions**************************************************

The inability to regulate emotions can be a feature of psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other mental-health conditions. People suffering from psychosis may have an altered perception of reality that may affect their regulation of emotions, and those suffering from bipolar disorder or depression may also report a loss of control over their emotions. Problems controlling emotions can also occur in relation to brain damage or disorders. These symptoms can be accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms or physical symptoms if they are related to a medical condition.  The inability to regulate emotions is common in young children, but when present to an extreme degree, it may indicate an abnormality such as an emotional or behavior disorder.
 
Lack of Facial Expressions**************************************************
A lack of facial expressions can occur in various conditions. Catatonia is a term that is used to describe a state of stupor or unresponsiveness in a person who is otherwise awake.  Lack of facial expressions is one sign of catatonia, which can occur in association with a psychiatric disorder, like schizophrenia. Diseases that cause damage to the brain and its function can also lead to a lack of responsiveness, including a lack of facial expressions. Examples include brain trauma and 
encephalitis. 
 
Lactose Intolerance**************************************************
Lactose intolerance is a condition in which the body is unable to fully digest lactose, a form of natural sugar found in milk. Lactose intolerance is not the same thing as a food allergy and is a relatively common condition. It is more common in Native Americans and people of Asian, African, and South American descent than among people of European ancestry. The condition results from a deficiency of lactase, an enzyme made in the small intestine that breaks down lactose. Symptoms occur when an affected person consumes milk or dairy products. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, 
bloating, vomiting (throwing up), diarrhea, and 
gas. The degree or severity of symptoms can vary among affected people.

Laryngitis**************************************************

Laryngitis is inflammation of the voice box, or larynx, resulting in voice changes such as hoarseness or loss of the voice completely in some cases. It is most commonly due to an infection such as the common cold or flu and typically follows a period of experiencing a cough or sore throat. However, laryngitis can also develop in response to chronic irritation of the larynx. For example, some conditions like gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), some cancers, chronic tonsillitis, and other conditions can lead to inflammation.  Voice overuse and irritants like cigarette smoke can also lead to irritation of the voice box and laryngitis.
 
Leg Pain**************************************************

Pain in the legs can occur as a result of conditions that affect bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, or skin. Leg pain can occur in the foot, ankle, knee, behind the knee, thigh, down the back of the leg, or in any part of the leg. It can occur at night, while lying down, or while running or 
exercising, depending upon the cause. Depending on the cause, leg pain can occur in one leg only or in both legs. Typically, the leg pain is a result of tissue inflammation that is caused by injury or disease. Either injury or chronic disease can cause inflammation to any of the tissues of the leg and lead to leg pain. Since the leg contains a number of different structures and tissue types, a wide variety of conditions and injuries can cause leg pain.
 
Leg Sores**************************************************

Leg sores can arise from trauma, infection, tumors, or chronic medical conditions. Any process of inflammation or tissue damage can manifest as a sore on the leg. Leg sores may affect primarily the skin or can extend into the subcutaneous tissues, muscles, bone, and deeper structures of the leg. Depending upon the exact cause, they may be associated with
 
Leg Swelling**************************************************
Leg swelling generally occurs because of an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the lower extremity. The medical term for leg swelling from excessive fluid in the tissues is peripheral edema. Persisting indentation of a swollen leg after pressure from a finger is known as pitting edema.
Common causes of leg swelling include salt retention, cellulitis, congestive heart failure, venous insufficiency, pregnancy, and medication side effects. Less common causes of leg swelling include blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis), parasite infection, lymphedema, liver disease and cirrhosis, kidney disease and nephrotic syndrome, broken ankle, broken leg, and diseases that cause thickness of the layers of skin, such as scleroderma and eosinophilic fasciitis. In these diseases, the leg swelling is typically characterized by nonpitting edema. When leg swelling occurs for unknown reasons, it is referred to as idiopathic edema.

 
Leukemia**************************************************
Leukemia is actually a group of different cancers of the blood cells. Leukemias can be acute or chronic, and people with chronic leukemias may not notice any symptoms before the condition is diagnosed with a blood test. Acute leukemias are more likely to cause symptoms. Symptoms of all forms of leukemia are related to the proliferation of abnormal blood cells and replacement of the bone marrow by the cancerous cells.
 
Limping**************************************************

Limping refers to any type of difficulty that occurs while walking. Limping can be considered to be a form of walking that favors the use of one leg over another and is most commonly due to diseases of or damage to the legs and feet, including all of the structures such as muscles, bones, joints, blood vessels, and nerves that make up the lower extremities.
 
Liver Cancer**************************************************

Malignant tumors of the liver are most commonly metastases, or areas of distant spread, from tumors that arise elsewhere in the body. These tumors are not true liver cancers; instead they are named by their site of origin, such as lung cancer metastatic to the liver. True liver cancers are malignancies that arise in the cells of the liver. Symptoms of liver cancer arise most commonly in the later stages of the disease and include weight loss, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, and abdominal swelling. These symptoms are fairly nonspecific and can occur with cancers in other locations as well as some chronic diseases. Other symptoms of liver cancer include a yellowish discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), enlarged and tender liver, and chalky, white-colored stools.

 
Loss of Appetite**************************************************
Loss of appetite, medically referred to as anorexia, can be caused by a variety of conditions and diseases. Some of the conditions can be temporary and reversible, such as loss of appetite from the effects of medications. Some of the conditions can be more serious, such as from the effects of underlying cancer. Any persisting lack of appetite should be evaluated by a health-care professional.
 
Loss of Speech**************************************************

Lack of speech or absence of speech can occur due to both medical and psychological conditions. Absent speech or mutism can occur as a sign of catatonia, a state in which one is unresponsive but otherwise awake. Catatonia can be a sign or schizophrenia or other psychiatric conditions involving psychosis. It may also be a sign of severe depression or other emotional disorders. The antipsychotic medications listed below are used in the treatment of emotional conditions that may manifest as catatonia with lack of speech.
 
Loss of Taste Sensation**************************************************

The sensations of taste and smell are related, so many disorders of the sense of taste are associated with a 
decreased or impaired sense of smell. These 
taste disorders can range from obstructions in or damage to the nose to damage to the brain and nervous system in general. The most common pure taste disorder is a phantom taste sensation; this is the perception of a "bad taste in the mouth" that does not go away. The decreased ability to taste certain types of foods is known medically as 
hypogeusia; the absence of taste entirely is termed 
ageusia. Dysgeusia refers to the presence of a metallic, rancid, or foul taste in the mouth. Taking certain medications can also interfere with the ability to taste. Some loss of taste sensation also occurs during the normal aging process, so elderly people may complain of decreased ability to taste foods. Sometimes, having a 
cold, sinus infection, strep throat, or 
upper respiratory infection can result in a decrease in taste sensation.
 
Loss of Temperature Sensation**************************************************

The loss of pain and/or temperature sensation can accompany any condition that damages the nerve pathways responsible for receiving, transmitting, or processing external stimuli. Therefore, problems with the peripheral nerves in the body as well as conditions affecting the brain or spinal cord may result in the loss of temperature sensation. A wide variety of conditions, ranging from tumors to chronic diseases to infections, can cause damage to the nerves that results in loss of sensation. When loss of sensation occurs in the setting of peripheral neuropathy (damage to the peripheral nerves in the body), antidepressant and antiseizure medications are sometimes used for relief.
 
Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension)**************************************************

Symptoms of low blood pressure, medically known as hypotension, relate to decreased blood flow to many areas of the body. Symptoms can include
 
Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)**************************************************
Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) means that blood levels of glucose are too low. This condition is most commonly a complication of treatment for diabetes. Symptoms of hypoglycemia vary among people. When blood sugar levels drop, symptoms can include
 
Low Libido**************************************************

A decrease in sex drive can develop both due to medical conditions as well as to psychological or emotional issues. Inhibited sexual desire is a type of sexual dysfunction that affects both men and women. A reduction in sexual desire has been associated with low testosterone 
levels in men. Likewise, women in the menopausal transition sometimes report a decrease in sex drive. Multiple types of chronic illnesses and chronic pain can also lead to a decrease in sex drive, likely through a combination of physical effects of the disease as well as the psychological stress associated with a chronic illness. Painful intercourse (dyspareunia) can lead to loss of libido in women. Psychological factors that may be associated with low libido include poor body image, anxiety, low self-esteem, stress, poor communication, lack of or breach of trust, and unresolved conflicts. Certain medications, such as some antidepressants, can also cause a reduction in sex drive.
 
Low Testosterone (Low T)**************************************************
Testosterone is a natural hormone produced by the testes in men; it is also produced in small amounts by the ovaries in women. Having low levels of testosterone is a condition that has been described in both men and women. Low testosterone levels can be caused by problems with the testes and ovaries themselves or conditions that affect the pituitary gland and hypothalamus of the brain. Aging is also a known cause of low testosterone in men, and obesity can also lower testosterone levels.
 
Low Urine Output**************************************************

Low urine output, or no urine output, occurs in the setting of kidney failure as well as in urinary obstruction. As the kidneys fail or become compromised in their ability to function, the kidneys lose the ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes and to remove waste products from the body. Additionally, red blood cell production (which is normally driven by a substance produced in the kidneys) decreases. Low urine output also occurs when there is a decreased blood supply to the kidney, such as occurs with dehydration or excessive blood loss. Obstruction of outflow of the urine, either due to tumors, 
enlargement of the prostate, or bladder problems can also reduce urine output. Reduced urine output as a result of kidney failure can 
be acute, as with toxins or sepsis, or chronic. Chronic renal failure develops over time and can result from poorly controlled diabetes or hypertension.

 
Lump or Mass on Gums**************************************************

The presence of a lump, or mass, on the gums can be caused by several different conditions. It may be felt as a bump or hard or soft lump anywhere on the gums. An infection, such as a bacterial infection or localized abscess, can 
appear as a mass on the gums. Oral cancers (gum or mouth cancer) or tumors of the teeth or jaw are rarer causes of a mass on the gums. A cyst of the jaw is also a possible cause of a lump or mass on the gums. Traumatic injuries and canker sores are some of the more common causes of a mass on the gums. Sometimes, the hormonal changes of pregnancy can cause a small lump or bump to form near the gum line, known as a pyogenic granuloma or granuloma gravidarum.
 
Lung Cancer**************************************************
In up to 25% of people who get lung cancer, there are no apparent symptoms at the time of diagnosis. In others, symptoms can occur from the cancer itself, from the metastatic spread of the cancer beyond its origin in the lung, or from so-called paraneoplastic syndromes that result from the production of hormone-like substances by the lung cancer cells. Common symptoms include
 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**************************************************

Symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, often referred to as simply lupus) can be quite different, because there are different types of lupus, and not all affected people show the same symptoms. Nevertheless, there are certain symptoms 
and signs commonly associated with the condition.
 
Lyme Disease**************************************************

Lyme disease is medically described as occurring in three phases, each with distinctive symptoms. The first phase is early localized disease, which occurs 
three to 30 days after the tick bite that transmitted the infection. This stage is characterized by skin inflammation. The rash that occurs is referred to as erythema migrans. It develops in about 70% of people who get Lyme disease. It starts at the site of the tick bite and expands over the next several days. It can eventually cover an area up to about 12 inches across. Some of the area may clear, giving the rash at times a bull's-eye appearance. The rash may feel warm to the touch, but it is usually not painful and does not itch. Some people get generalized symptoms in this stage as well, such as fever, chills, headache, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes. Some people may have only the generalized symptoms without developing a rash.
 
Swollen Lymph Nodes (Lymphadenopathy)**************************************************
Gland swelling commonly refers to enlargement of the lymph glands, also known 
as lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small rounded or bean-shaped masses of lymphatic 
tissue surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Lymph glands (nodes) are 
located in many places in the lymphatic system throughout the body. Lymph nodes 
filter the lymphatic fluid and store special cells that can trap cancer cells or 
bacteria that are traveling through the body in the lymph fluid. The lymph nodes 
are critical for the body's immune response and are principal sites where many 
immune reactions are initiated.
 
Malnutrition**************************************************

Malnutrition is the lack of adequate nutrition, either as a result of imbalances, deficiencies, or excesses in a person's intake of food and nutrients. This can be due to eating too little, eating an improper diet, or having a medical condition that results in the body's being unable to use food and nutrients. Malnutrition can also refer to overnutrition and obesity and is the condition of being poorly nourished.
 
Mastitis**************************************************

Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast tissue, most often caused by an infection. Mastitis is most common in lactating women. Symptoms include a hard, firm area in the breast that is usually painful. Other symptoms include warmth or redness of the overlying skin, pain in the nipple area, and swelling. Pain while breastfeeding, fever, chills, and generally feeling unwell (malaise) can be other symptoms of mastitis. Sometimes, blood or pus can be seen in breast milk when mastitis is present.

 
Measles (Rubeola)**************************************************

Measles, also known as rubeola, is a respiratory disease characterized by a rash all over the body in addition to fever, runny nose, and cough. It is typically a childhood illness that can be complicated by ear infection or pneumonia; associated symptoms for these conditions can include ear pain or fullness, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Other symptoms common in measles include reddened eyes, sore throat, sensitivity to light, and spots on the lining of the mouth known as Koplik's spots. Koplik's spots look like white grains surrounded by a red rim and usually appear at the back of the mouth. Symptoms and signs of measles usually appear one to two weeks after contracting the infection.

 
Memory Loss**************************************************
Memory loss, also referred to as amnesia, is an abnormal 
degree of forgetfulness and/or inability to recall past events. Depending on the 
cause, memory loss may have either a sudden or gradual onset, and memory loss may be 
permanent or temporary. Memory loss may be limited to the inability to recall 
recent events, events from the distant past, or a combination of both. Although 
the normal aging process can 
result in difficulty in learning and retaining new material, normal aging itself 
is not a cause of significant memory loss unless there is accompanying disease 
 that is responsible for the memory loss. 
 
Meniere's Disease**************************************************

Excess pressure in the inner ear results in the typical symptoms of Ménière's disease. These include variable hearing loss that fluctuates, vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and feelings of pressure or fullness in the ears. The vertigo may cause nausea and vomiting. The hearing loss may worsen over time. Other symptoms that may occur include headache, dizziness, and sensitivity to sounds. The severity and frequency of the symptoms is variable among affected people. Between attacks or episodes, patients are free of symptoms. Attacks can be accompanied by anxiety, blurred vision, jerking eye movements, palpitations, fast heart rate, diarrhea, and trembling.
 
Meningitis**************************************************
The symptoms of meningitis arise due to inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis can occur due to infections or due to diseases that cause systemic inflammation in the body. Headache and fever are common symptoms. Stiff neck is also a characteristic symptom in adults and older children.  These symptoms may come on suddenly and may be severe.
 
Menopause**************************************************

Menopause is a time at which a woman's reproductive capacity ends. It is defined as the absence of menstrual periods for a period of 12 consecutive months. Prior to the actual menopause, a woman may experience irregular periods and irregular episodes of vaginal bleeding.
 
Menstrual Cramps**************************************************
Menstrual cramps are the cramping in the lower abdomen, 
usually in the first or second day of the 
menstrual cycle. 
These are caused contractions of the uterus as it expels 
its unneeded contents, and also by the passage of clotted 
blood through the cervix. Ibuprofen 
(Advil) or other pain relievers 
can reduce the severity of cramps; some women report that 
 exercise is also helpful.
 
Metallic Taste in the Mouth**************************************************

A metallic taste in the mouth is a relatively common side effect of medications. Dozens of different drugs produce changes in the sense of taste as a side effect, that can include the perception of a metallic taste. Examples include many antibiotics and some antihistamines. In the majority of these cases, the condition is only temporary and resolves once the medication is discontinued. Cancer chemotherapy medications may also produce a metallic taste in the mouth as a side effect.
 
Middle Ear Infection (Otitis Media)**************************************************

Ear pain is the main symptom of middle ear infection, medically known as otitis media. The pain may be accompanied by a sense of pressure or fullness of the ear. Discharge from the ear canal and fever may be present. Temporary hearing loss can result from middle ear infections, and the infection may occur in the presence of signs and symptoms of an upper respiratory infection, such as nasal congestion, runny nose, or cough. In infants and young children, generalized symptoms like fussiness, irritability, trouble feeding, or sleep problems can sometimes be attributed to middle ear infections.

 
Migraine**************************************************

Symptoms of a migraine come from specific physiologic changes that occur within the brain that cause the headache and associated symptoms of a migraine. Migraine headaches are often associated with sensitivity to light, sound, and smells. They may be preceded by an aura, a perceptual change that occurs prior to the headache. The aura may take the form of visual changes, such as partial blindness, or seeing spots or blind spots with a zigzag border. Alterations in smell or hearing can also signify an aura. Hallucinations, feelings of prickly skin, or weakness can also be signs of an aura. Auras usually occur 15-20 minutes prior to a migraine attack and are present in only 15%-20% of migraine sufferers.
 
Miscarriage**************************************************
The hallmark symptom of miscarriage, also known as spontaneous abortion or early pregnancy loss, is vaginal bleeding. The bleeding may be very heavy, and blood clots and/or tissue may be passed along with the bleeding. The bleeding is usually accompanied by abdominal pain and cramping. The pain may radiate to the low back, vagina, pelvic area, or buttocks. Fever and chills are not common but may occur if the miscarriage is a result of an infection.

 
Missed Menstrual Period**************************************************
While a missed menstrual period is the hallmark of early pregnancy, missing a period can be due to a number of factors and conditions. The term amenorrhea is used by doctors to describe the absence of menstruation. Primary amenorrhea (in which a woman does not begin menstruating) is very rare, while secondary amenorrhea (absence of periods in a previously menstruating woman) is much more common. Periods may also be irregular, with skipped periods, for the first few years after a woman has begun menstruating and in the 
perimenopause (the time period preceding menopause).
 
Mood Swings**************************************************

Mood swings refer to rapid changes in mood. The term may refer to minor daily mood changes or to significant mood changes as seen with mood disorders such as major depression or bipolar depression. Mood swings can also occur in women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The menopausal transition, specifically the time around approaching menopause or perimenopause, is associated with mood swings in some women. Mood swings can be seen with other conditions as well, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dementia, and thyroid conditions.
 
Morning Sickness**************************************************

Morning sickness (medically known as nausea and vomiting of pregnancy) is a term used to refer to nausea and often vomiting that typically occurs in early pregnancy. Morning sickness is very common and affects up to 75% of pregnant women at some time. It can be accompanied by other symptoms of early pregnancy, such as fatigue or tiredness. Despite the name, morning sickness or nausea can strike at any time during the day or night. Nausea of pregnancy usually starts about the sixth week of pregnancy, but some women may experience it earlier. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a term that refers to an unusually severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy that often requires hospitalization.
 
Tic**************************************************

A tic is a repetitive and spasmodic contraction of the muscles, usually of the face. It appears as an uncontrollable movement of the body and  may be referred to as a twitch, spasm, motor tic, or jerk. Examples may include blinking the eyes, grimaces, grunts, groans, tongue clicking, throat clearing, or twitching the nose. Tics can also occur outside the facial muscles in the arms or legs, but this is less common. In contrast to motor tics described above, vocal tics are repeated sounds or words that occur without intention. Tics are more common in children than adults, and boys are more commonly affected than girls. Tics can be suppressed if a person concentrates on suppressing them, but this becomes increasingly difficult with time. Tics are a characteristic symptom of Tourette syndrome and tic disorders, but they may also occur due to other medical conditions.
 
Mouth Sores**************************************************

Sores or localized abnormalities inside the mouth can arise from a number of causes. Mouth sores can occur on the tongue, gums, lips, or inside the cheeks. They may appear as ulcers or red or white patches in the mouth. Bleeding may sometimes occur if ulceration is severe. Bite injuries to the tongue or inside of the cheek are a common cause of mouth sores. Also commonly, mouth sores represent aphthous ulcers, also known as canker sores or aphthous stomatitis. These shallow, painful mouth ulcers often occur in susceptible individuals during times of stress, infection, or changes in immune status. Certain medications (for example, methotrexate [Trexall]) can cause canker sores as well as deficiencies in some B 
vitamins (1, 2, 6, and 12), iron, folic acid, and zinc. However, irritation, injury, burns, or infection of any of the tissues in the oral cavity can also lead to mouth sores. Sores in the mouth can occur with certain systemic (affecting multiple locations within the body) diseases such as Crohn's disease, 
Behçet's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Rarely, mouth sores are among the initial signs of 
oral cancers. Herpes simplex virus infection causes so-called cold sores, which are typically located on the lips, but they can also occur on the gums. Among the 
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the chancres of 
syphilis can occur as mouth sores.
 
MRSA Infection**************************************************
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes a number of different clinical presentations. Most MRSA infections involve the skin and subcutaneous tissues, producing manifestations such as boils, abscesses, rash, or 
blistering areas. Boils and abscesses are localized collections of pus as a result of the bacterial infection. The inflamed area may be reddened, tender, swollen, and warm to the touch. These signs can also appear in MRSA-infected surgical incisions. When MRSA infection spreads beyond these areas to involve the bloodstream, systemic (body-wide) symptoms occur. These can include fever, chills, low blood pressure, joint pains, severe headaches, shortness of breath, and widespread rash.

 
Multiple Myeloma**************************************************
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of certain cells of the bone marrow called plasma cells. Multiple myeloma is a form of bone marrow cancer. Plasma cells normally produce our antibodies. Multiple myeloma features abnormal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow, destructive bone lesions, and the production of abnormal proteins, specifically antibodies. Multiple myeloma is also referred to as myeloma.
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**************************************************
Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary widely, and a description of "typical"
symptoms is difficult. All the symptoms involve changes in neurologic 
functioning, but there are striking differences among patients in the type, 
severity, and frequency of these symptoms. Different disease patterns such as 
relapsing-remitting (RR), primary-progressive (PP), secondary-progressive (SP), 
and progressive-relapsing (PR) classify the condition according to the 
development and progression of symptoms over time. Relapsing-remitting (RR) 
multiple sclerosis is the most common type, in which symptoms (exacerbations of 
the condition) are followed by periods of time with reduced or no symptoms. 
These relatively symptom-free periods, known as remissions, can last for days or 
for many years. 
 
Mumps**************************************************
Many people do not develop symptoms when they become infected with the mumps virus, so they may never know they had the infection. Others develop symptoms such as fever, swollen and tender parotid glands (the salivary glands located beneath the ears), and headache. Other possible symptoms can include fatigue, loss of appetite, and muscle aches. The swollen salivary glands typically appear about the third day of the infection, with the more nonspecific symptoms occurring earlier. The gland swelling can last up to 10 days. Symptoms in adults tend to be worse than those in children.
 
Muscle Cramps**************************************************
A muscle cramp is an involuntary contraction of a muscle without relaxation afterward. Normal movement involves alternation of contraction and relaxation of the muscles of the body. Muscles that stabilize the body, like those of the head, trunk, and neck, work similarly. When a muscle contracts involuntarily, it is referred to as a spasm; a forceful and prolonged spasm becomes a cramp.
 
Muscle Pain (Myalgia)**************************************************
Muscle pain originates in any of the muscles in the body. The medical term for muscle pain is myalgia. Muscle pain may arise due to injury or overexertion, infections of the soft tissues, or inflammatory conditions. A number of conditions can be associated with generalized aches and pain, such as influenza, that are perceived to be muscle pain. Muscle pain can be localized to one muscle group or diffuse, involving multiple muscle groups. Muscle pain due to injury or overuse is most commonly localized to one area. Depending upon the cause, muscle pain can be mild or severe and debilitating. Muscle pain is the hallmark symptom of some chronic conditions like fibromyalgia. Related symptoms that can occur with muscle pain are tenderness, swelling, redness, or fever.
 
Spasticity**************************************************

Spasticity is a condition of increased muscle tone in which muscles acquire a state of near constant contraction, or activity. Muscle spasticity causes a loss of range of motion of the affected area and a loss of function. There is also a resistance to movement by an examiner. 
In the affected muscles, spasticity can also cause symptoms such as
 
Loss of Speech**************************************************

Lack of speech or absence of speech can occur due to both medical and psychological conditions. Absent speech or mutism can occur as a sign of catatonia, a state in which one is unresponsive but otherwise awake. Catatonia can be a sign or schizophrenia or other psychiatric conditions involving psychosis. It may also be a sign of severe depression or other emotional disorders. The antipsychotic medications listed below are used in the treatment of emotional conditions that may manifest as catatonia with lack of speech.
 
Clubbing**************************************************

Clubbed nails were described in ancient times by Hippocrates and is a clinical sign that may accompany a number of different disease processes. Clubbing refers to swelling in the tip of the digit that results in loss of the normal angle seen between the nail and the nail bed. The fingertips appear broader and rounder when clubbing is present. While the exact mechanism that leads to clubbing is poorly understood, it is known to develop most often in people with conditions of the heart or lungs that decrease the total amount of oxygen in the blood. However, clubbing can also accompany malignancies and some gastrointestinal conditions. Clubbing may have a slow onset to the point where the individual is unaware of the change. It is usually painless but can rarely be accompanied by discomfort in the fingertips. Rare skin conditions including pachydermoperiostosis and palmoplantar keratoderma are unusual causes of 
nail clubbing.
 
Nail Discoloration**************************************************
Nail discoloration, in which the nails appear white, 
yellow, or green, can result from different infections and conditions of the 
skin. In about 50% of 
cases, discolored nails are a result of infections with common fungi that can be 
found in the air, dust, and soil. There are many species of fungi that can 
affect nails. By far the most common, however, is called Trichophyton rubrum. 
This type of fungus has a tendency 
to infect the skin and is therefore known as a dermatophyte. 
Pseudomonas is a 
type of bacteria that infects the nail bed and 
results in a greenish color to the nails. Red or black (that may sometimes appear 
bruised) nails may result from a 
 hematoma (a collection 
of blood) under the nail as a result of trauma (including 
ingrown toenails). 
 
Nail Fungus (Onychomycosis)**************************************************

The term fungal nails, medically known as onychomycosis, refers to a fungal infection of the toenails or fingernails. Fungal infection of the nails may cause changes in the nail itself and its appearance, including 
symptoms and signs such as
 
Nail Pitting**************************************************

Pitting of the nails, typically the fingernails, is characterized by depressions in the surface of the nail. Nail pitting is caused by defective development of the layers of the superficial nail plate. It is common in patients with psoriasis and can affect up to 50% of people suffering from this condition. Nail pitting can also be associated with other conditions, including connective tissue disorders, alopecia areata, and sarcoidosis. Any condition that can cause a superficial and localized inflammation of the skin (dermatitis) can also affect the nails and result in nail pitting. Nail pitting can be associated with other abnormalities of the nails, including nail separation, flaking or crumbling, or other damage to or changes in the nail. Nail pitting that is associated with disease processes generally shows involvement of multiple or all nails, while trauma to an individual nail bed can cause localized pitting or disruptions in a single nail.
 
Nail Separation**************************************************

Separation of the nail from the nail bed, medically known as onycholysis, is a common condition that results in a white appearance of the affected part of the nail. 
Fingernail or toenail separation can have numerous causes but is typically related to trauma or a 
fungal infection of the nails. 
Nail separation can sometimes be associated with other abnormalities of the nails, including 
nail pitting, flaking or crumbling, or other damage to or changes in the nail. 
Toenail or fingernail separation is generally painless and may occur gradually, without the affected individual being aware of a distinct cause. In some instances, onycholysis can be related to systemic conditions, including connective tissue disorders or hyperthyroidism.
 
Nasal Congestion**************************************************
Nasal congestion, or "stuffy nose," is a term that refers to the obstruction to the flow of air in and out of the nose. In contrast, the term "runny nose" refers to a discharge (fluid) coming from the nasal passages. Nasal congestion most commonly is the result of inflammation and swelling of the lining tissues of the nasal passages and sinuses. Less commonly, anatomical obstructions (for 
example, a deviated nasal septum, foreign bodies) may lead to nasal congestion. Prolonged use of certain nasal decongestant sprays or drops can lead to a worsening of nasal congestion. Rarely, tumors of the nasal passages or chronic medical conditions may be the cause of nasal congestion.
 
Nausea**************************************************

Nausea 
is the sensation of an urge to vomit. Nausea can be acute and short-lived, or it can be prolonged. When prolonged, it is a debilitating symptom. Nausea (and vomiting) can be psychological or physical in origin. It can originate from problems in the brain or organs of the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder). Nausea also may be caused by diseases of many organs outside of the gastrointestinal system. Therefore, the diagnosis of the cause of prolonged nausea may not be easy. All stimuli that cause nausea work via the vomiting center in the brain, which gives rise to the sensation of nausea and coordinates the physical act of vomiting.
 
Neck Pain (Cervicalgia)**************************************************
Pain in the neck can be more than just a hassle. 
Neck pain can come from disorders and diseases of any structure in the neck. There are seven vertebrae that are the bony building blocks of the spine in the neck (the cervical vertebrae) that surround the spinal cord and canal. Between these vertebrae are discs and nearby pass the nerves of the neck. Within the neck, structures include the neck muscles, arteries, veins, lymph glands, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, esophagus, larynx, and trachea. Disease of any of these structures can lead to neck pain, including cervical spinal stenosis, myofascial pain, ankylosing spondylitis, spinal tumor (rare), cervical foraminal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis.
 
Self-Neglect**************************************************

Self-neglect implies the inability or unwillingness to attend to one's personal needs or hygiene. It may manifest in different ways, such as not attending to one's nutrition, hygiene, clothing, or acting appropriately to care for medical conditions. Self-neglect can occur as a result of dementia, brain damage, or mental illnesses like depression or psychotic disorders. Some people who suffer from self-neglect may engage in unhealthy behaviors such as 
substance use or abuse, 
tobacco use, promiscuity, or inappropriate use of prescription medications. The list of conditions associated with self-neglect is very broad, and treatment options depend upon the precise cause of self-neglect. Antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are used when certain mental illnesses are the cause. Extreme self-neglect has been referred to as Diogenes syndrome.

 
Neonatal Jaundice**************************************************

Jaundice refers to a yellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) due to a buildup of the bile pigment, bilirubin.  High bilirubin levels in the blood result in the characteristic yellowish discoloration of jaundice.
 
Inverted Nipple**************************************************

An inverted nipple is a condition in which the nipple is pulled inward into the breast instead of pointing outward. 
This condition can also be called nipple inversion, nipple retraction, or invaginated nipple, although some observers distinguish these two variations. Nipple retraction can be a congenital (present at birth) condition as a normal variant in some women. In other cases, it may arise as a result of disease or trauma. Any condition that causes inflammation or scarring of the tissues behind the nipple may cause the nipple to pull inward.

 
Inverted Nipple**************************************************

An inverted nipple is a condition in which the nipple is pulled inward into the breast instead of pointing outward. 
This condition can also be called nipple inversion, nipple retraction, or invaginated nipple, although some observers distinguish these two variations. Nipple retraction can be a congenital (present at birth) condition as a normal variant in some women. In other cases, it may arise as a result of disease or trauma. Any condition that causes inflammation or scarring of the tissues behind the nipple may cause the nipple to pull inward.

 
Enterovirus (Non-Polio Enterovirus Infection)**************************************************

Many people who become infected with non-polio enteroviruses either have no symptoms from the infection or experience only a mild illness. When symptoms do occur, they often resemble those of the common cold: fever, malaise, cough, and runny nose. More serious infections can cause wheezing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, reddened skin, or cyanosis (a bluish tinge to the skin).
 
Hand and Finger Numbness**************************************************
Numbness of the fingers and/or hands typically is a result of conditions that affect the nerves and/or blood vessels that supply the hand. Numbness of the fingers or hands is often associated with tingling. These symptoms are referred to as paresthesia of the fingers. Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the nerves of the extremities that often results in numbness or tingling. Longstanding or uncontrolled diabetes is one of the major causes of peripheral neuropathy. Alcohol abuse is another cause of peripheral neuropathy. A number of conditions are associated with numbness, burning, pain, or tingling of the fingers and hand, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Raynaud's disease, and vascular diseases.
 
Tingling Tongue**************************************************

Numbness or tingling ("pins and needles") sensations in the tongue, medically known as paresthesia of the tongue, most commonly occur due to damage to the nervous system. The medical term for the absence of sensation is 
anesthesia. Damage to the lingual nerve that supplies the tongue has been reported as a complication of dental procedures or surgery, such as 
wisdom tooth extraction, 
implants, or root canal procedures. Other conditions that damage the nervous 
system, like multiple sclerosis, as well as brain conditions such as stroke, can also cause numbness and tingling of the tongue. Sometimes, these sensations extend to involve the lips and/or jaws. Tingling of the tongue associated with nerve damage can occur both before and after eating.
 
Numbness Toes**************************************************
Numbness of the toes generally is a result of conditions that affect the nerves and/or blood vessels that supply the foot. Numbness of the toes is often associated with tingling. Numbness and tingling sensations in the toes is referred to as paresthesia of the toes.
 
Vertical Ridges on the Fingernails**************************************************

Having vertical (longitudinal) ridges on the fingernails refers to the presence of tiny raised lines or ridges that run up and down the length of the nail. Ridges are among the different kinds of nail abnormalities that can develop due to aging, nail injury, or trauma, or underlying medical conditions. Many people notice an increase in vertical ridges of the fingernails as they age, and this can be a normal development. Aging has been described as the predominant cause of vertical ridges on the fingernails. 
Onychorrhexis is the medical term used to describe longitudinal ridges on the nails that often accompany brittle nails.
 
Osteopenia**************************************************

Osteopenia is a bone condition characterized by a decreased density of bone, but the density is not decreased enough to warrant a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteopenia leads to bone weakening and an increased risk of breaking a bone (fracture). Osteopenia represents a lesser degree of bone loss than osteoporosis. When there are other risk factors present (like corticosteroid medication use, smoking, or other bone conditions) that also increase the risk of 
bone fractures, medications may be required.

 
Osteoporosis**************************************************

Osteoporosis most often causes no symptoms. The main symptom that osteoporosis can cause is pain as a result of 
a 
bone fracture. Other symptoms that osteoporosis can cause are loss of height, hunched posture, and a hump in the upper back (dowager's hump), each as a direct result of compression fracture of vertebrae in the spine.
 
Ovarian Cancer**************************************************

Ovarian cancer may not cause any specific signs or symptoms, particularly in its early stages. When it does cause symptoms, these may be nonspecific and vague. Symptoms can include
 
Bladder Spasms**************************************************

A bladder spasm occurs when the bladder muscle squeezes suddenly without warning, causing an urgent need to release urine. A bladder spasm is referred to medically as a contraction of the detrusor muscle. The spasm can be so severe as to cause the leakage of urine (incontinence), which is characteristic of the condition urge incontinence, or overactive bladder. Sometimes, a bladder spasm is associated with severe cramping, burning, or pain. Bladder spasms can occur in people of any age. They are a common cause of daytime incontinence in children. They can be related to medical conditions that interfere with the function of the nervous system or may be related to infections or damage to the bladder itself. Certain medications and foods are also irritating to the bladder and may cause bladder spasms.
 
Overactive Bladder (OAB)**************************************************
Symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) result from sudden and involuntary contractions of the bladder muscles, leading to a
 
Penile Pain**************************************************

Pain arising from the penis is often a result of a sexually transmitted infection and can be associated with burning, itching, painful urination, discharge, or blood in the urine. Infections or inflammation of the bladder or prostate can also result in penile pain. Balanitis is a term that refers to an infection and inflammation under the foreskin of the penis, and this is another potential cause of penile pain. Trauma, persistent erection (priapism), cancers, and Peyronie's disease (the development of scar tissue within the penis) are other causes. Sickle cell anemia may cause priapism due to blockages of small blood vessels in the penis.
 
Painful Gums**************************************************

Painful, sore, red gums can be signs and symptoms of gingivitis (inflammation of the gums) or, more likely, periodontitis (inflammation of the attachment fibers of the teeth and supporting bone), which can arise due to a number of different causes, including poor oral hygiene with improper brushing or flossing. Inflammation of the gums may manifest as
 
Painful Intercourse**************************************************

Painful intercourse is medically known as dyspareunia. It can occur in women due to the involuntary contraction of the vaginal muscles, a condition known as vaginismus. Painful intercourse can also occur as a symptom of genital infections, including the 
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Abnormalities or tumors of the female genital tract can sometimes cause bleeding or pain during intercourse for women. Some medications can result in insufficient lubrication and painful intercourse, and the lowered estrogen levels associated with perimenopause and menopause may lead to vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse.
 
Pale Skin**************************************************

Paleness of the skin refers to an abnormal lightening of the skin or mucous membranes. Pale skin may be generalized (occurring all over the body) or localized to one area. It is often accompanied by paleness or pallor in the linings of the eyes, inside of the mouth, and on the surface of the tongue. True paleness of the skin is related to the thickness and density of blood vessels beneath the skin and not to the amount of melanin (skin pigment) that is present. However, some people may confuse loss of skin pigmentation (as with 
albinism) with paleness. In dark-skinned people, paleness may only be apparent when examining the mucous membranes. Pale skin generally results from a decrease in blood flow, as with fainting or shock. It may also result from a reduction in the number of red blood cells (anemia).
 
Palpitations**************************************************
Palpitations are the unpleasant sensations of irregular and/or forceful
beating of the heart in the chest. This symptom can be caused by a change in the rate or rhythm, or by an increase in the force of the contraction of the heart muscle. In some patients with palpitations, no heart disease or abnormal
heart rhythms can be found. In others, palpitations result from abnormal heart rhythms 
called 
arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are heartbeats that are too slow, too rapid, irregular, or
too early.
 
Pancreatic Cancer**************************************************

Pancreatic cancer typically does not cause symptoms until it has grown, so it is most frequently diagnosed in advanced stages rather than early in the course of the disease. In some cases, jaundice (a yellowish discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes) without pain can be an early sign of pancreatic cancer. Other symptoms that can occur with more advanced disease are nausea, vomiting, weight loss, itching skin, and decreased appetite. Pale stools, back pain, abdominal pain, dark urine, abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck can be present as well.

 
Pancreatitis**************************************************

Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, a gland located behind the stomach that produces insulin and other enzymes that aid digestion. Abdominal pain (sometimes described as stomach pain) is the main symptom of pancreatitis, but other symptoms can include
 
Panic Attack**************************************************
Panic attack symptoms come on suddenly and are unexpected. The symptoms can be severe and disabling, and those who experience panic attacks may lead to the development of irrational fears (phobias) of certain situations. Panic attack symptoms can be varied and may cause the sufferer to feel that death or a catastrophic event is imminent.
 
Paralysis**************************************************
Paralysis is the loss or impairment of voluntary muscular power. Paralysis can result from either diseases involving changes in the makeup of nervous or muscular tissue or those that are the result of metabolic disturbances that interfere with the function of nerves or muscles. Depending upon the cause, paralysis may affect a specific muscle group or region of the body, or a larger area may be involved. When only one side of the body is affected, the condition is known as hemiplegia. In other instances, both sides of the body may suffer the effects, leading to diplegia or bilateral hemiplegia. When only the lower limbs are affected by paralysis, it is called paraplegia. When all four limbs are affected, it is referred to as quadriplegia. The term palsy is sometimes used to refer to the loss of muscle power in a body part.
 
Paraneoplastic Syndrome**************************************************

Paraneoplastic syndrome is a group of symptoms caused by a substance that is produced by a tumor or in reaction to a tumor (see 
the causes section below for more information). A number of different types of paraneoplastic syndrome can occur, depending upon the substances produced by the tumor.  The symptoms produced can involve different organs and organ systems, including the endocrine, neuromuscular or musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, cutaneous, hematologic, gastrointestinal, or renal systems. Therefore, paraneoplastic syndromes can cause a wide variety of symptoms. Fever is a common manifestation of many paraneoplastic syndromes, along with loss of appetite and wasting (cachexia). Other symptoms 
and signs depend upon the specific organ system.
 
Paranoia**************************************************

Paranoia refers to the perception or suspicion that others have hostile or aggressive motives in interacting with them (for example, "they are out to get me"), when in fact there is no reason for these suspicions. People experiencing paranoia believe that others are persecuting them and have delusional ideas about themselves as central figures in scenarios that in reality have little relevance to them. They may mistrust others and remain often in a state of suspicion. Minor feelings of paranoia are common, but severe paranoia can cause significant fear and anxiety and can have a pronounced effect on social functioning. Feelings of paranoia can be observed with many psychological disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as with a number of medical diseases that can affect brain function, ranging from Alzheimer's disease to multiple sclerosis. Intoxication from alcohol or drug abuse may also lead to feelings of paranoia.
 
Peeling Skin**************************************************

Peeling skin can occur as a reaction to a number of inflammatory processes of the skin or damage to the skin. Sunburn is a classic example, but other conditions that can cause peeling skin include various forms of dermatitis, eczema, and certain infections.  Burns of any degree of severity can result in peeling skin. Some types of medications, such as topical retinoids used for acne, can cause peeling skin. Adverse reactions to medications such as cancer
chemotherapeutic agents can also lead to peeling skin. Any condition that results in the formation of a blister can result in peeling skin at the area of the blister. Although peeling skin is not typically associated with a rash, some skin rashes may be associated with peeling skin. Treatment is dependent upon the underlying cause.
 
Pelvic Pain**************************************************

Pain in the pelvic area can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. These organs include the bladder and rectum in both men and women as well as the uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes in women. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the pelvis even though it is arising from other organs near the pelvis, such as the intestines. Pelvic pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding, depending on the specific cause. The characteristics of the pain -- location, timing, duration, etc., are important in diagnosing its cause along with any associated symptoms such as vaginal discharge or bleeding. Some types of pelvic pain may only be apparent at certain times, such as during sexual activity or during urination. Persisting pelvic pain should be evaluated by a physician.
 
Penile Discharge**************************************************

Penile discharge may be watery (clear) or cloudy (containing pus). The discharge may also be bloody. Urinary tract infection (UTI) or a sexually transmitted infection are common causes of penile discharge. Penile discharge is often accompanied by pain or burning during urination and a need to urinate frequently. Itching can also accompany penile discharge. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and
Trichomonas infections are common infections that may cause penile discharge.  Genital herpes rarely causes penile discharge.

 
Penile Itching**************************************************

Itching in the area of the penis or external genital organs occurs for many of the same reasons that itching occurs elsewhere on the body. Infections, including those that cause sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a primary cause of penile itching. Jock itch, the term used to refer to an inflammation and irritation of the groin area, may spread to the penis and result in itching of the skin of the penis. Further causes include fungal infections, scabies, pubic lice, tight undergarments, 
allergic reaction, skin friction, bacterial infection, and other conditions. Sometimes, systemic diseases such as chickenpox can spread to the genital areas, resulting in itching. Depending on the cause, penile itching may be associated with other symptoms such as
 
Penile Pain**************************************************

Pain arising from the penis is often a result of a sexually transmitted infection and can be associated with burning, itching, painful urination, discharge, or blood in the urine. Infections or inflammation of the bladder or prostate can also result in penile pain. Balanitis is a term that refers to an infection and inflammation under the foreskin of the penis, and this is another potential cause of penile pain. Trauma, persistent erection (priapism), cancers, and Peyronie's disease (the development of scar tissue within the penis) are other causes. Sickle cell anemia may cause priapism due to blockages of small blood vessels in the penis.
 
Gum Disease**************************************************

Gum disease is inflammation of the gums. Gum disease can also be referred to as periodontal (around the teeth) disease, periodontitis (inflammation of areas around the teeth), and gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). Gingivitis and periodontitis are two different types of gum disease that vary in severity. Mild gum disease (gingivitis) simply causes redness or occasional bleeding during toothbrushing. In more serious cases of gum disease, there is damage to the soft tissues and bones that support the teeth (periodontitis), leading to separation of the teeth from the gums. The separated areas, or pockets, easily become irritated and inflamed. Severe cases of gum disease can result in tooth loss.
 
Peripheral Neuropathy**************************************************

Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the peripheral nerves and results in a tingling, painful, or burning sensation in the extremities. It most commonly occurs in the legs. Other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can include weakness and numbness. Poorly controlled diabetes is one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, but a number of conditions can be responsible for damage to the peripheral nerves. Examples of other causes include alcoholism, kidney failure, vitamin deficiency, and 
shingles. Some medications, including certain cancer chemotherapy drugs, can cause peripheral neuropathy.

 
Phlebitis**************************************************

Phlebitis (inflammation of a vein) often occurs together with blood clot formation in the vein, known as thrombophlebitis. If phlebitis is mild, it may not produce any symptoms. When symptoms are present, pain, tenderness, bulging of the vein, warmth, and redness of the skin are the common symptoms. In some cases, fever may be present. Infections that cause phlebitis may lead to the drainage of pus from the involved site. Thrombi (clots) in thrombophlebitis can sometimes be felt in the form of hardened cords along the course of a vein. When thrombophlebitis occurs in the deep veins of the lower extremity, swelling of the leg as well as pain and tenderness can occur.

 
Photophobia**************************************************

Sensitivity to light is the inability to tolerate light, medically known as photophobia. In someone who is light sensitive, any type of light source (sunlight, fluorescent light, incandescent light) can cause discomfort. Photophobia typically causes a need to squint or close the eyes, and headache, nausea, or other symptoms may be associated with photophobia. Symptoms may be worse with bright light. People with light-colored eyes are more likely to have sensitivity to bright light than those with darker-pigmented eyes. 
Light sensitivity is caused by a number of conditions that affect the eye (such as iritis, uveitis, and keratitis), as well as conditions that affect the entire body. Migraine
headache is a common cause of photophobia, with a majority of migraine sufferers reporting sensitivity to light.
 
Pinkeye (Conjunctivitis)**************************************************
Pinkeye can be caused either by infectious or noninfectious processes. When infections are responsible, most cases are due to viral infections. Bacterial infections can also cause pinkeye symptoms, however. Pinkeye is characterized by reddening of the conjunctiva of the eyes, discharge from the eyes, and can be accompanied by other signs of infection like sinus congestion and runny nose. The eyelids may also be swollen.
 
Pleurisy (Pleuritis)**************************************************
Pleurisy is inflammation of the linings around the lungs (each lining is called the pleura). There are two layers of pleurae; one covering the lung and the other covering the inner wall of the chest.  These two layers are lubricated by pleural fluid.
Pleurisy is characterized by pain in the chest with breathing. Pleurisy can also cause
 
PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome)**************************************************
Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a group of unpleasant symptoms linked to a woman's menstrual cycle, typically occurring 
one to two weeks before the menstrual period begins. PMS symptoms vary widely among women and range in severity from mild to debilitating. PMS typically includes physical and emotional symptoms.
 
Pneumonia**************************************************
Pneumonia often starts with symptoms typical of a cold or upper respiratory infection, like sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough. As the infection develops in the lung, high fever is apparent along with chills and a cough that produces thick sputum. Chest pain can occur if the outer layer (pleura) of the lungs is involved in the inflammatory process. The skin color may become bluish or purplish if there are insufficient levels of oxygen in the blood. Nonspecific symptoms that can accompany pneumonia include headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and weakness.

 
Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)**************************************************

Symptoms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease include pain in the back and sides, between the hips, and the ribs. Headache is also a common symptom. In the form of the condition that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, symptoms may not show up until later in life when the cysts develop in the kidney. In other cases, symptoms of this form of the condition can develop in childhood. Other symptoms include high blood pressure, kidney stones, and blood in the urine. A second form of polycystic kidney disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. This form is known as "infantile" polycystic kidney disease, and symptoms can begin in utero or at birth. Children with this condition have frequent urination, high blood pressure, urinary tract infection, and growth problems and delays. Other symptoms can include varicose veins and hemorrhoids.

 
Poor Hygiene**************************************************

Poor hygiene can be a sign of self-neglect, which is the inability or unwillingness to attend to one's personal needs. Poor hygiene often accompanies certain mental or emotional disorders, 
including severe depression and psychotic disorders. Dementia is another common 
cause of poor hygiene. Other people may develop poor hygiene habits due to 
social factors such as poverty or inadequacy of social support. Physical 
disabilities can also interfere with one's ability to care for oneself and may 
result in an individual being unable to attend to personal hygiene. There is no treatment for poor hygiene, although antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are used when certain mental illnesses are the cause of this behavior.
 
Malnutrition**************************************************

Malnutrition is the lack of adequate nutrition, either as a result of imbalances, deficiencies, or excesses in a person's intake of food and nutrients. This can be due to eating too little, eating an improper diet, or having a medical condition that results in the body's being unable to use food and nutrients. Malnutrition can also refer to overnutrition and obesity and is the condition of being poorly nourished.
 
Postnasal Drip**************************************************

Postnasal drip is the accumulation of mucus in the back of the nose and throat, causing the sensation of secretions dripping downward through the back of the nose. Postnasal drip is a common finding with rhinitis, 
or inflammation of the airways within the nose. Accompanying symptoms can include
 
Postpartum Depression**************************************************

Postpartum depression is more than just the "blues" after giving birth. The symptoms include
 
Pregnancy**************************************************
Particularly in the early stages, symptoms of pregnancy can vary among women. 
And while the absence of menstrual periods is the classic and hallmark pregnancy 
symptoms, there are many other changes in the body, even during early pregnancy 
that result in characteristic signs and symptoms. 
 
Prostate Cancer**************************************************

Many of the symptoms of prostate cancer relate to the enlargement of the gland, so they are not specific to prostate cancer and can be caused by other conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia, 
which enlarges the prostate gland. Very early prostate cancer may also be small and not produce any specific symptoms. Other symptoms of prostate cancer localized to the prostate can include
 
Proteinuria (Protein in the Urine)**************************************************

Proteinuria refers to excess protein in the urine. While some amount of protein in the urine is normal, excessive amounts of protein in the urine are a sign that the kidneys are not working properly due to a number of different reasons. The main protein in the blood is albumin, and this is also the main protein in urine. For this reason, proteinuria is sometimes referred to as albuminuria. Diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure) are two chronic conditions that can cause kidney damage over time, leading to excess protein in the urine. Acute (sudden onset) problems with the kidneys, like acute renal failure, also cause proteinuria. Some conditions can transiently increase the amount of protein in the urine, including emotional stress, vigorous exercise, fever, or exposure to heat or cold extreme temperatures.

 
Anal Itching (Pruritus Ani)**************************************************
Anal itching (pruritus ani) is due to irritation of the skin around the anus accompanied by a desire to scratch. The intensity of itching increases with moisture, pressure, and sitting. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort described as burning and soreness. Scratching only makes the discomfort worse.  Treatment of anal itching is to shower gently without directly rubbing or irritating the skin and to clean and pat dry the anus thoroughly. Use of moist pads rather than toilet paper after bowel movements can be helpful. Local application of cortisone cream may also reduce inflammation and itching, though prolonged use of cortisone may be damaging to the skin. If anal itching is prolonged, a physician should be consulted and a search made for the cause.
 
Psoriasis**************************************************

The hallmark symptoms of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, are plaques composed of thick, scaly skin. These are typically reddened in appearance with silvery scales that have sometimes been said to resemble ashes.  The elbows, knees, and scalp are common sites of involvement, although other areas of skin can be affected, as well. The condition can start as a few red 
bumps on the skin, and in mild cases, small areas of dry skin may be the only symptoms. Itching and burning sensations can be associated with the lesions on the skin. The nails may be affected, and psoriasis of the nails causes ridged, thick, or pitted nails and can ultimately lead to separation of the nails from the nail bed. Symptoms of arthritis, including 
stiffness, pain, and 
swelling of the joints, occur in some people with psoriasis. There are different forms of psoriasis that can affect different areas and produce different kinds of skin changes. For example, pustular psoriasis is characterized by blisters filled with pus. Fever, chills, and diarrhea can accompany this type of psoriasis.

 
Psoriatic Arthritis**************************************************

About 10%-15% of people with psoriasis -- a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes changes in the skin, including raised, reddened patches of skin with silvery white scales -- also develop arthritis. The inflammation of the skin can precede the joint inflammation by years in some cases. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis arise from inflammation and resemble those of other kinds of arthritis. The joints of the knees, ankles, and feet are commonly involved. Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation in the spine and the eyes, skin, heart, kidneys, mouth, and various organs and is one of the forms of arthritis known as "spondyloarthropathies."
 
Ptosis**************************************************

A drooping or sagging of the eyelid is medically known as ptosis or blepharoptosis. Drooping eyelids may occur on both sides (bilateral) or on one side only (unilateral), in which case it is more easily noticed. 
Congenital ptosis is eyelid drooping that is present at birth; when it develops later, it is referred to as acquired ptosis. Depending upon the severity of the condition, drooping eyelids may be barely noticeable or quite prominent. Some sagging of the skin and connective tissues occurs during the normal aging process, potentially leading to drooping of the eyelids. Other causes include conditions that affect the muscles and nerves of the eyelid as well as conditions that affect the skin and connective tissues of the eyelid. Rarely, tumors of the brain or eye area are the cause of drooping eyelids.
 
Rash**************************************************
The word "rash" means a change in the color and texture 
of skin that usually causes an outbreak of red patches or bumps on the skin. In common usage of the term, a "rash" can refer to many different skin conditions. A rash can be caused, directly or indirectly, by a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. 
Alternatively, a rash may be unrelated to an infectious organism, such as from 
an underlying medical illness. Medications, chronic medical conditions, and 
allergic reactions (hives) are among the multiple different causes of rash.
 
Rectal Bleeding (Blood in Stool, Hematochezia)**************************************************
Blood in the stool can be bright red, maroon in 
color, black and tarry, or occult (not visible to the naked eye). Causes of 
blood in the stool range from harmless, annoying conditions of the gastrointestinal 
tract such as hemorrhoids and anal tears 
(anal fissures) from straining against hard stools with constipation to serious conditions such as cancer. Blood in the 
stool should be evaluated by a health care professional. 
 
Fecal Incontinence**************************************************

Fecal incontinence refers to the inability to hold feces (stool) in the rectum. This is typically due to failure of voluntary control over the anal sphincters, permitting untimely passage of feces and gas. Fecal incontinence is also known as rectal incontinence or bowel incontinence. Fecal incontinence is not a disease itself but is a symptom that can occur as a result of different kinds of diseases or injuries. Incontinence of stool can result from damage to the nerves or muscles of the rectum and anus, or conditions affecting the intestines. Overflow incontinence, also known as paradoxical diarrhea, occurs in people with chronic constipation when stool fills the rectum, hardens, and becomes impacted. Liquid stool then may leak around the fecal mass, producing symptoms similar to incontinence.

 
Rectal Pain**************************************************

Rectal pain is pain or discomfort in the lower portion of the gastrointestinal tract. The term is often used interchangeably with pain in the anus or anal pain. It is a fairly common problem and can result from conditions such as hemorrhoids or 
anal fissures. Rectal pain can be associated with symptoms such as prolapse, pressure, or 
bleeding. Rectal or anal pain can also occur with inflammatory diseases of the bowel, localized infections, or minor injuries to the area. Some causes of rectal pain, such as hemorrhoids or anal fissures, can be accompanied by other symptoms like blood in the stool or bleeding. 
Diarrhea or constipation may also be present. Cancers are a rare cause of rectal pain. Levator syndrome, also known as levator ani syndrome, is a spasm of the levator ani muscle that causes fleeting pain in the rectum. 
Proctalgia fugax is another term that refers to rectal pain occurring from muscle spasm.
 
Red Spots on the Skin**************************************************

Red spots on the skin are a common medical complaint. When the spots occur in outbreaks, they are sometimes termed rashes. Rashes can occur due to infections of the skin, disseminated infections (that have spread throughout the body), allergic reactions, or irritations of the skin. When a red bump or rash is flat, it is medically known as a macule. When the red spot is raised, it is known as a papule. Erythema is the medical term for redness of the skin.
 
Red Streaks on the Skin**************************************************

Red streaks on the skin are a characteristic sign of an infection of the skin or subcutaneous tissues, especially when the infection is spreading from its original site. In this case, other symptoms, such as pain, tenderness, swelling, and warmth typically accompany the red streaks. Red streaks can also be a sign of injury, such as a scratch injury. Striae, sometimes referred to as stretch marks, are streaks of reddened, thin skin that can occur as a result of rapid weight gain or abdominal enlargement during pregnancy. They can also occur in the setting of certain chronic disorders of the connective tissue. An excess of cortisol (Cushing's syndrome) can also cause striae.

 
Restless Leg Syndrome**************************************************
Restless leg syndrome is a common cause of painful legs. 
The leg pain of restless leg syndrome typically eases with motion of the legs 
and becomes more noticeable at rest. Restless leg syndrome also features 
worsening of symptoms during the early evening or later at night. The 
characteristic nighttime worsening of symptoms in people with restless legs 
syndrome frequency leads to insomnia.
Restless leg syndrome usually begins slowly. Over time, 
the legs become more affected. Less frequently, restless leg syndrome can affect 
the arms.

 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**************************************************

Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can be related to the joints themselves or may be systemic (involving the whole body). Symptoms typically come and go and result from inflammation. Joint aches and stiffness, muscle aches, low-grade fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, and loss of energy are characteristic of active disease. Joints can become warm, swollen, reddened, painful, and tender. Joint pain and stiffness, particularly early in the morning, are often early symptoms. Usually, multiple joints on both sides of the body are affected. Depending on the specific joints that are affected, other possible symptoms include limping, hoarseness, and painful walking. In children, crying, irritability, and poor appetite are often observed. Firm lumps or firm bumps under the skin (subcutaneous nodules called rheumatoid nodules) can occur around the elbows and fingers where there is frequent pressure.

 
Tinnitus**************************************************
Ear ringing and other abnormal ear noises is medically called tinnitus. People with tinnitus perceive buzzing, roaring, and pulsitile sounds when no actual sound is present.
 
Roseola**************************************************

Roseola is a mild viral illness of childhood. It is characterized by high fever that typically comes on suddenly and lasts for three to five days. Other symptoms of roseola are mild nasal congestion, eye redness, and a rash that appears after the fever has resolved. The rash is usually pink in color and consists of tiny flat or slightly raised dots. Nonspecific symptoms can occur in ill infants and children. These can include fatigue, poor feeding, diarrhea, runny nose, and irritability.

 
Runny Nose**************************************************

Stuffy nose is a term often used to refer to obstruction to the flow of air in and out of the nose, while runny nose refers to a discharge (fluid) coming from the nasal passages. This is often a watery, clear liquid but may be thicker and viscous. Both stuffy and runny nose are associated with inflammation and swelling (congestion) of the inner lining of the nasal passages and sinuses. 
Rhinitis is a term that refers to inflammation of the nasal passages, and
rhinorrhea is the medical term for runny nose. A viral infection (the common cold) is the most common cause of a stuffy and/or runny nose, but allergies, influenza, other viral infections like 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sinus infections also may cause these symptoms and signs. Postnasal drip may be an associated symptom. This occurs when there is excess production of mucus by the lining cells of the nose, which accumulates in the back of the nose or in the throat.
 
Scarlet Fever**************************************************

Scarlet fever, an infection with toxin-producing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, usually begins from an infection in the throat. Symptoms of this infection include sore throat, headache, enlarged tonsils, fever, and chills. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can accompany these symptoms. The tongue can be swollen and have a red, bumpy appearance sometimes referred to as "strawberry" tongue. A rash is also characteristic of scarlet fever. It usually begins as small, flat red areas on the skin and can develop into small, bumpy 
red areas. It usually begins on the chest and trunk and extends to the arms and legs, but the palms and soles of the feet are usually spared. The rash has been described as feeling like sandpaper. Skin creases (groin, elbows, underarms) may appear more reddened. The skin can start to peel as the rash fades.

 
Schizophrenia**************************************************

The symptoms of schizophrenia vary in quality and intensity from individual to individual, but delusions or a failure to recognize what is real is characteristic.  The delusions of schizophrenia can cause hallucinations in sight (visual hallucination), sound (auditory hallucination), and/or touch (tactile hallucination). Other symptoms of schizophrenia include
 
Seizure (Epilepsy)**************************************************
A seizure is the uncontrolled electrical activity in the 
brain, which may produce a physical convulsion, minor physical signs, 
thought disturbances, or a combination of symptoms.
 
Self-Neglect**************************************************

Self-neglect implies the inability or unwillingness to attend to one's personal needs or hygiene. It may manifest in different ways, such as not attending to one's nutrition, hygiene, clothing, or acting appropriately to care for medical conditions. Self-neglect can occur as a result of dementia, brain damage, or mental illnesses like depression or psychotic disorders. Some people who suffer from self-neglect may engage in unhealthy behaviors such as 
substance use or abuse, 
tobacco use, promiscuity, or inappropriate use of prescription medications. The list of conditions associated with self-neglect is very broad, and treatment options depend upon the precise cause of self-neglect. Antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are used when certain mental illnesses are the cause. Extreme self-neglect has been referred to as Diogenes syndrome.

 
Shaking Hands (Hand Tremors)**************************************************

A tremor is an unintentional rhythmic movement of any part of the body. When hands are shaking or trembling, this is typically a tremor of the hands. Tremors are usually caused by problems with areas of the brain that control movements. Neurological problems can cause tremors, but they can also be caused by metabolic problems and toxins (such as alcohol) that affect the brain and nervous system. Shaking hands and tremor can also be a side effect of different medications.
 
Shingles**************************************************

Shingles typically causes painful skin bumps or blisters. Even before the skin lesions appear, the pain of shingles can be severe. The skin pain is often described as a burning sensation of the skin with heightened sensitivity. The rash of shingles consists of red blisters that eventually burst and ooze. The rash occurs in a band-like distribution along the path of a nerve. The blisters eventually crust over (form a scab) and heal. Sometimes, symptoms like chills, diarrhea, and headache can occur as a person develops shingles. The nearby lymph nodes may be swollen.
 
Shortness of Breath (Dyspnea)**************************************************
Shortness of breath has many causes affecting either the breathing passages and lungs or the heart or blood vessels. An average 150-pound (70 kilogram) adult will breathe at an average rate of 14 breaths per minute at rest. Excessively rapid breathing is referred to as hyperventilation. Shortness of breath is also referred to as dyspnea.
 
Shoulder Pain**************************************************

Shoulder pain can be a result of injury or disease of the shoulder joint. Injury can affect any of the ligaments, bursae, or tendons surrounding the shoulder joint. Injury can also affect the ligaments, cartilage, menisci (plural for meniscus), and bones of the joint. The design of the shoulder joint is such that it sacrifices stability for mobility. As an extremely mobile joint that plays a central role in the action of a major extremity, the shoulder is at risk for injury. Common injuries of the shoulder can lead to inflammation of the bursae (bursitis) or tendons (tendonitis or tendinitis) and result in 
a torn rotator cuff with dysfunction, impingement, as well as instability and frozen shoulder. Labral tears can be from torn cartilage. 
Fracture of the bones of the shoulder (such as from 
biking falls) can cause intense shoulder pain.
 
Sinus Infection (Sinusitis)**************************************************

Sinus infection is characterized by an infection of the lining tissues of the 
sinuses within the skull. The resulting inflammation leads to blockage of the openings that allow drainage of fluid from the sinus. Early symptoms and signs of a sinus infection are often related to the respiratory infection (such as a cold) that led to the inflammation of the sinus tissues. Symptoms can include pain or pressure sensations over the involved areas of the face along with facial tenderness and swelling. Stuffy nose, or nasal congestion, can occur as well as drainage or discharge from the nose. Cough may be present, and sometimes patients have fever.
 
Sleep Apnea**************************************************

Sleep apnea, or the cessation of breathing for short periods during sleep, can cause symptoms at night as well as troublesome symptoms during the day or waking hours. At night, sleep apnea is often associated with
 
Small Intestine Cancer**************************************************

There are different kinds of tumors that can arise in the small intestine, although cancer of this organ is far less common than colorectal cancer. Symptoms can be similar to those of any gastrointestinal malignancy and include weight loss, abdominal pain or cramps, a mass or lump in the abdomen, and blood in the stool. Other symptoms and signs can include nausea, vomiting, and intestinal obstruction or perforation.
 
Sneezing**************************************************

Sneezing (sternutation) is the act of expelling a sudden and uncontrollable burst of air through the nose and mouth. Sneezing can occur for a variety of reasons that have in common an irritation of the lining (mucous membranes) of the nose or throat. It is rarely a sign of a serious illness. Many environmental triggers can lead to sneezing, including air pollutants, pollen, dry air, and dust. Spicy foods can sometimes cause sneezing. 
Allergies, 
colds, and the flu are common causes of sneezing. Drug withdrawal, emotions, and certain medications are less common causes of sneezing. Some people may sneeze as a reaction to exposure to bright light (known as a 
photic sneeze reflex). Depending upon the reason for the sneezing, other symptoms can also occur, including
 
Snoring**************************************************
Snoring is a sound resulting from turbulent airflow that 
causes the tissues of the nose and throat to vibrate during sleep. The turbulent 
air flow is related to a narrowing at some point in the nose, mouth, or throat. Different 
people who snore may have various reasons for the narrowing of the air spaces 
leading to snoring. 
 
Sore Throat (Pharyngitis)**************************************************
Pain in the throat may be caused by a variety of inflammations of the larynx, pharynx, or tonsils. Throat soreness is typically associated with 
painful swallowing. Inflammation of the pharynx (pharyngitis) is the most common form of sore throat and is usually from virus infection.
 
Sore Tongue**************************************************

A number of different conditions can result in pain and/or the presence of abnormalities, bumps, ulcers,  or sores 
or spots on the tongue as well as symptoms like pain, 
swelling, or burning of the tongue. Problems with the tongue can result from infections, tumors, chronic medical conditions, trauma, or toxins. Inflammation of the tongue is medically known as glossitis. Pain in the tongue is known as glossodynia. Inflammation may occur on the sides of the tongue, the tip of the tongue, on the back of the tongue, or throughout the tongue. Because soreness or painful 
lesions on the tongue can have a wide variety of causes, treatment and outlook depend upon the particular condition that is responsible. Depending upon the exact cause, other symptoms and conditions can be associated with a sore tongue, including
 
Spasticity**************************************************

Spasticity is a condition of increased muscle tone in which muscles acquire a state of near constant contraction, or activity. Muscle spasticity causes a loss of range of motion of the affected area and a loss of function. There is also a resistance to movement by an examiner. 
In the affected muscles, spasticity can also cause symptoms such as
 
Koilonychia**************************************************

Spoon-shaped or spooning fingernails refers to a concavity in the fingernail itself, resulting in a depression in the nail that gives an appearance of a spoon shape to the entire nail. This growth disturbance in the nail is medically known as koilonychia. The spooning is typically such that a water droplet may be placed and held in the depression within the nail. This pattern can sometimes be seen in normal infants, but it disappears as the child ages. Koilonychia is a component of the nail-patella syndrome, a genetic disease characterized by numerous abnormalities including musculoskeletal and kidney abnormalities. Spooning fingernails can also result from trauma, exposure to certain solvents, or it may be associated with chronic medical conditions. In particular, koilonychias is associated with iron deficiency.
 
Sneezing**************************************************

Sneezing (sternutation) is the act of expelling a sudden and uncontrollable burst of air through the nose and mouth. Sneezing can occur for a variety of reasons that have in common an irritation of the lining (mucous membranes) of the nose or throat. It is rarely a sign of a serious illness. Many environmental triggers can lead to sneezing, including air pollutants, pollen, dry air, and dust. Spicy foods can sometimes cause sneezing. 
Allergies, 
colds, and the flu are common causes of sneezing. Drug withdrawal, emotions, and certain medications are less common causes of sneezing. Some people may sneeze as a reaction to exposure to bright light (known as a 
photic sneeze reflex). Depending upon the reason for the sneezing, other symptoms can also occur, including
 
Stiff Neck**************************************************

Stiffness in the neck can arise as a result of disorders and diseases of any structure in the neck. The neck contains seven cervical vertebrae that are the bony building blocks of the spine in the neck; these vertebrae surround the spinal cord and canal. Between these vertebrae are discs, and nearby pass the nerves of the neck. Within the neck, other structures and organs include the neck muscles, arteries, veins, lymph glands, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, esophagus, larynx, and trachea. Neck stiffness can be associated with symptoms such as
 
Stomach Cramps**************************************************

The term stomach cramps is nonspecific and is used to refer to a number of different symptoms or sensations rather than true muscle cramps of the stomach. People often refer to a "stomachache" or "abdominal cramps" to refer to pain that is perceived anywhere in the abdominal area. As such, the list of potential causes is extremely varied. Organs of the abdomen include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, and problems or diseases of all of these organs may be the source of pain. Some typical causes of abdominal pain and associated symptoms that arise from the gastrointestinal tract include
 
Stomach Ulcer (Peptic Ulcer)**************************************************
Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by sores, or ulcerations, in the lining tissues of the stomach or the duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine. Peptic ulcers can be caused by a number of conditions, including certain medications, excessive alcohol use, and other medical conditions. The primary symptom of peptic ulcer is upper abdominal pain. The pain can be sharp or dull and is often described as burning. Some affected people have indigestion that may quickly resolve after taking antacids or eating foods that neutralize stomach acids. Other people with peptic ulcers may not have symptoms at all or may have only very mild symptoms. The severity of the ulcers is not related to the severity of the symptoms they cause; mild ulcers may cause severe pain, while severe ulcers may only cause mild symptoms.
 
Stool Color & Texture Changes (Black, Red, Maroon, Green, Yellow, Gray, Tarry, Sticky)**************************************************

Changes in stool (feces) color are often harmless and reflect dietary influences. The normal brown color of stool occurs due to the presence of bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed as a breakdown product of hemoglobin (from red blood cells) in the liver and is secreted into the bile, which enters the intestines. If the intestinal contents travel at a normal speed, chemical changes in bilirubin produce stool that is light to dark brown. The stool may appear green if the intestinal contents pass through the bowel more rapidly.
 
Unusual Behavior**************************************************

The observation of strange behavior depends at least in part upon the perceptions of the observer. For most people, behaviors that are observed as out of the ordinary or strange are a feature of psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other mental-health conditions. Examples of conditions in which psychosis (altered perception of reality) are present include schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. People suffering from psychosis may have an altered perception of reality that often affects their behavior, leading them to act in ways that may be perceived as strange. Problems controlling one's behavior can also occur as a result of brain damage or disorders. People suffering from dementia may display strange behaviors. Behavioral changes can be accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms or by physical symptoms if they are related to a medical condition.  Substance abuse and drug overdoses can also lead to problems with behavior.
 
Strep Throat**************************************************

Symptoms of a Streptococcus infection of the throat (streptococcal pharyngitis) are related to the inflammation of the throat and surrounding tissues. It is not possible to determine whether a sore throat is due to strep infection without specialized testing. A severe sore throat is a common symptom, also some people may have a strep infection with only mild throat pain. Redness and swelling of the throat may be present. There may be white patches in the throat and on the tonsils if pus is present (medically known as a tonsillar exudate). Odynophagia (difficulty swallowing due to the pain) is common. Enlarged, swollen tonsils may be present.
 
Stroke**************************************************

The symptoms of a stroke vary depending upon the area of the brain affected by a lack of oxygen. All strokes involve symptoms that relate to impairment of nerve function. The symptoms typically arise suddenly and most commonly occur on one side of the body. Symptoms and signs of stroke can include numbness, weakness, tingling, or vision loss or changes. Confusion, changes in the level of consciousness, trouble speaking, trouble understanding speech, vertigo, and balance problems are other common symptoms. Headache, nausea, and vomiting sometimes accompany a stroke, particularly when the stroke involves bleeding inside the brain.

 
Sty**************************************************

Typically, a sty produces a bump on one of the eyelid at the site of the gland that is blocked. Symptoms and signs such as
 
Suicide**************************************************
Suicide is a potentially preventable public health problem that counts for 
over 1% of all deaths in the U.S. In 2001, suicide was the 11th leading cause of 
death in the U.S. Among young people (aged 15 to 24), suicide is the third most 
common cause of death. Four times as many men die by suicide than women, and 73% 
of all suicide deaths are white males. 
 
Swimmer's Ear (Otitis Externa)**************************************************

Otitis externa, sometimes known as swimmer's ear, is an inflammation or infection of the ear canal, the tube that leads from the eardrum to the outer ear. The term "swimmer's ear" is used because this infection often occurs in people who have been swimming or in the water. In addition to 
ear pain, symptoms can include
 
Swine Flu**************************************************

Swine flu (swine influenza) is a respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that infect the respiratory tract of pigs, producing most of the same symptoms in pigs as human flu produces in people. In certain cases, people have developed the swine flu infection when they are closely associated with pigs, such as farmers or pork processors. Modern flu outbreaks that have occurred due to flu viruses that contain genes from swine and other types of flu viruses have been referred to as swine flu.  Most recently, the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak was due to a virus that was a mix of swine, human, and avian influenza viruses. In 2011, a new swine flu virus was detected, H3N2 influenza.
 
Swollen Ankles and/or Swollen Feet**************************************************
Swelling of the feet and ankles can occur as a result of conditions involving the local extremities as well as systemic conditions (diseases and conditions that affect the entire body).  Localized processes such as injuries and infections may lead to a swollen foot and/or ankle only on the involved side. Swelling of the ankle on one side is often a result of sprains or strains. Sometimes diseases that affect the entire body, such as heart disease and kidney or liver failure, can result in excess fluid buildup (edema) that is often concentrated in the legs and feet, leading to swelling not only of the ankles but also of the feet and lower legs. This can also occur with obstruction of the venous system, as may occur with pregnancy and obesity. Diseases of the joints, such as arthritis, can also affect the joints of the ankle and foot, leading to swelling of the involved areas. Treatments for swollen ankles and swollen feet depend on the particular cause, but anti-inflammatory medications are often used to manage the pain associated with 
strains and sprains.
 
Swollen Eyes**************************************************

Swelling of the eye, also referred to as periorbital puffiness, refers to the presence of excess fluid (edema) in the connective tissues around the eye, most commonly the eyelids. A swollen eye can result from trauma, infections, or other injuries to the eye area. Other 
signs and symptoms can be associated with swelling of the eye, including excess tear production or discharge, eye irritation, redness, dryness, or obstructed or impaired vision, depending on the cause. Prolonged crying, trauma, or eye injury is a common cause of swollen eyes. Virtually any cause of inflammation to the eye area may manifest as eyelid swelling, although allergic reactions are likely the most common cause. With allergic reactions, the eyes may also be red and itchy as well as swollen. Rarely, systemic conditions (affecting the entire body) may result in fluid retention, including fluid retention in the tissues around the eyes. With Graves' disease of the thyroid gland, proptosis or exophthalmos can occur. This means protrusion or bulging of the eyeball within the eye socket. Puffiness of the eyelids can also occur with this condition.
 
Swollen Joints**************************************************

Swollen joints refers to the enlargement of the joints, usually as a result of an inflammatory process or injury to the joint or to surrounding structures. Joint swelling may be accompanied by other symptoms, including
 
Swollen Knee**************************************************

A swollen knee is a common result of trauma or injury to the knee, such as sports-related injuries or automobile accidents. Falls and overuse injuries are another common cause of knee injury.
 
Swollen Lip**************************************************

Swelling of the lips can arise due to different conditions. Trauma 
or injury to the lip and mouth area is an obvious cause of swollen lips. Allergic reactions, either to foods, 
medications, or other substances, can often be accompanied by swelling of the lips. This may be accompanied by other allergic symptoms, such as hives and itching. Angioedema is a condition in which there is swelling of the tissue beneath the skin, and this is often concentrated around the eyes and lips. Some infections (such as herpes simplex virus infection) can result in blisters 
(sometimes referred to as cold sores) and localized swelling of the lips. Infections and inflammatory conditions of the skin can also lead to inflammation and swollen lips (cheilitis). Less commonly, medical conditions 
or illnesses that affect the entire body may cause lip swelling, sometimes in association with fluid retention or swelling in other areas of the body.
 
Swollen Lymph Nodes (Lymphadenopathy)**************************************************
Gland swelling commonly refers to enlargement of the lymph glands, also known 
as lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small rounded or bean-shaped masses of lymphatic 
tissue surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. Lymph glands (nodes) are 
located in many places in the lymphatic system throughout the body. Lymph nodes 
filter the lymphatic fluid and store special cells that can trap cancer cells or 
bacteria that are traveling through the body in the lymph fluid. The lymph nodes 
are critical for the body's immune response and are principal sites where many 
immune reactions are initiated.
 
Swollen Testicles (Testicular Swelling)**************************************************

Testicular swelling, like 
pain in the testicle, can arise from several different causes, some of which constitute a medical emergency. Testicular swelling may be perceived when there is localized enlargement of a testicle or a more generalized enlargement of the scrotum. It may be one-sided or bilateral and may or may not be accompanied by pain and other symptoms.
 
Swollen Tongue**************************************************

Swelling of the tongue can occur due to inflammation of the tongue, known as glossitis, the presence of abnormal substances (such as amyloid protein) in the tongue, the collection of fluid in the tongue as a result of different disease processes, or tumors (including tongue or other oral cancers) that infiltrate the tissues of the tongue. An enlarged 
or swollen tongue can also occur as an allergic reaction to medications or other substances. In this case, the swelling is due to fluid accumulation in the tissues of the tongue, medically known as angioedema. A dramatically swollen tongue can lead to breathing problems and may be a medical emergency. Treatment of allergic reactions that include swollen tongue can include epinephrine, antihistamines, and/or steroid medications.
 
Swollen Tonsils**************************************************

Swollen tonsils can accompany a number of different 
infections of the upper respiratory tract. Some people have larger tonsils than others, and it is possible to have large tonsils without associated symptoms or problems. Tonsillitis refers to inflammation of the tonsils, which typically occurs due to infection. Infection is most commonly due to viruses or bacteria. Tonsillitis is a common illness, especially in children. It is possible to have multiple episodes of tonsillitis throughout life. Tonsillitis is often accompanied by other symptoms, including sore throat, cough, sneezing, 
enlarged lymph nodes, fever, chills, hoarseness, headache, muscle aches, or fatigue. When the tonsils are infected, they may also appear to be coated with yellowish-white pus. 

 
Tachycardia**************************************************

Tachycardia is a heart rate that is too fast. Tachycardia occurs normally in times of stress, anxiety, or fear, but the heart rate returns to normal when the precipitating event or stimulus is removed. It also occurs as a normal response to intense exercise. In some medical conditions, the heart rate may be persistently elevated. Examples include certain arrhythmias of the heart. Thyroid diseases can also cause an elevation of the heart rate. The heart rate may be elevated when body temperature is high or due to taking certain medications. Cigarette smoking and excessive caffeine intake also cause tachycardia, as well as abuse of alcohol and recreational drugs. Other causes of fast heart rate include anemia, panic disorder, and diseases that damage the heart itself.

 
Testicular Pain (Pain in the Testicles)**************************************************

Testicular pain can have a number of different causes, some of which constitute a medical emergency. Trauma is a common cause of testicular pain when the scrotum is injured, most commonly as a result of blunt trauma. Testicular torsion is a condition in which the testicle twists inside the scrotum, causing an interruption in the blood supply to the testicle. Testicular torsion is an emergency, since interruption of the blood supply can lead to tissue death of the affected testicle. Inflammation of the testicle or epididymis can also lead to testicular pain. Sometimes, pain from other conditions, such as kidney stones, may be perceived in the scrotum.
 
Swollen Testicles (Testicular Swelling)**************************************************

Testicular swelling, like 
pain in the testicle, can arise from several different causes, some of which constitute a medical emergency. Testicular swelling may be perceived when there is localized enlargement of a testicle or a more generalized enlargement of the scrotum. It may be one-sided or bilateral and may or may not be accompanied by pain and other symptoms.
 
Thirst**************************************************

Thirst is the feeling of needing to drink something. It occurs whenever the body is dehydrated for any reason. Any condition that can result in a loss of body water can lead to thirst or excessive thirst. For this reason, thirst is a characteristic symptoms of certain medical conditions, most notably diabetes mellitus. Thirst may be accompanied by other signs of dehydration such as decreased urine output, reduced sweating and tear production, muscle cramps, weakness, 
lightheadedness, and nausea. Dehydration and thirst may be minor or severe, depending upon the amount of water lost by the body. Polydipsia is the medical term that refers to increased or excessive thirst.
 
Throat Cancer**************************************************

Throat cancers may not cause any symptoms if they are very small and have not spread at the time of diagnosis. Sometimes, an area of irritation or discoloration on the lining issues of the throat is the only sign of an abnormality. Depending upon the extent of spread of the cancer, other symptoms can include swelling of nearby tissues, 
enlarged lymph nodes, trouble breathing, difficulty speaking, neck or 
throat pain, 
ear pain, 
painful swallowing or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), and headache. 
Pain or 
ringing in the ears may occur in some cases. Bleeding can occur from some throat cancers. In advanced stages of throat cancer, symptoms like fatigue and unexplained weight loss may be present.

 
Thrush (Oral Candidiasis)**************************************************

Oral thrush is a type of yeast infection of the mouth and throat. The yeast that causes oral thrush is typically Candida albicans. This infection is common in babies and can occur in people of any age. A white tongue is a common sign, and this can be associated with white patches in the throat or anywhere in the mouth, such as the palate or inner cheeks. Soreness and mouth pain can also be present. In severe cases, the infection can spread into the throat and esophagus and may lead to pain or 
problems with swallowing. Fever may be present if the infection spreads widely.

 
Tic**************************************************

A tic is a repetitive and spasmodic contraction of the muscles, usually of the face. It appears as an uncontrollable movement of the body and  may be referred to as a twitch, spasm, motor tic, or jerk. Examples may include blinking the eyes, grimaces, grunts, groans, tongue clicking, throat clearing, or twitching the nose. Tics can also occur outside the facial muscles in the arms or legs, but this is less common. In contrast to motor tics described above, vocal tics are repeated sounds or words that occur without intention. Tics are more common in children than adults, and boys are more commonly affected than girls. Tics can be suppressed if a person concentrates on suppressing them, but this becomes increasingly difficult with time. Tics are a characteristic symptom of Tourette syndrome and tic disorders, but they may also occur due to other medical conditions.
 
Tingling in Hands and Feet**************************************************
Tingling in the hands and feet is often associated with other symptoms like pain, burning, or numbness in the hands and feet. These type of sensations commonly reflect damage to the nerves in the area (neuropathy); because these are peripheral areas of the body, the term 
peripheral neuropathy is used to refer to this type of symptom. Peripheral neuropathy has a number of causes and varies in severity among affected people. Vitamin deficiency, diabetes, and kidney failure are among the medical causes of tingling in the hands and feet due to nerve damage. Taking certain medications can also cause tingling in the hands and feet. Other potential causes of peripheral neuropathy include autoimmune diseases, toxins, alcoholism, and infections.
 
Toe Pain**************************************************

Pain in the toe can arise due to abnormalities or injury to any of the structures in the toe, including skin, nerves, bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues. Toe pain is a fairly common symptom, since our feet are constantly exposed to injury by walking, running, or other athletic activity, and moving around. Some types of toe pain can be accompanied by numbness, burning, warmth, or other symptoms. The most common causes of toe pain include ingrown toenails, bunions, cuts or scrapes, other injuries, blisters, and corns and calluses. Arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and other types of arthritis) and infections are additional causes of toe pain.
 
Toothache**************************************************
The symptoms of toothache include sharp pain or dull pain in or around a tooth. The most common cause of a toothache is a dental cavity as a result of tooth decay. Dental cavities and toothache can be prevented by proper oral hygiene. Another common cause of toothache is gum disease. Toothache can also be a result of an injury or an abscess of the tooth. Toothache symptoms can be caused by a problem that does not originate from a tooth or the jaw. Symptoms of toothache can be mimicked by sinus infection, shingles, and other diseases.
 
Concussion**************************************************

A concussion is a form of minor brain trauma in which the function of the brain becomes altered but no abnormalities can be detected by imaging tests such as CT scans. Symptoms of a concussion are typically short-lived and go away on their own. The symptoms may be obvious or may be so subtle that the affected person does not realize they have suffered a concussion. Some of the more common symptoms of concussion include
 
Tremors**************************************************
Tremors are abnormal movements of the body that occur because of conditions affecting the nervous system. None

Tunnel Vision**************************************************

Tunnel vision occurs when one loses visual acuity in the peripheral visual fields while retaining visual acuity in the central regions. The vision can be considered to be constricted and concentrated in the central area, as when one is inside a tunnel looking out. Tunnel vision can be caused by any type of damage to the optic nerve, to the retina of the eye, or to areas in the brain responsible for processing of visual input. Loss of peripheral vision may be a symptom of some of the conditions that cause a generalized loss of vision. Glaucoma is a common cause of true 
tunnel vision.
 
Ulcerative Colitis**************************************************

Symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary among affected individuals. Typical symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Depending upon the degree of inflammation and the location of the inflammation within the colon, other signs and symptoms can occur. Rectal pain, a sense of urgency in needing to defecate, and tenesmus (ineffective and painful urge to defecate) are symptoms of rectal involvement. Weight loss, fever, night sweats, fatigue, and dehydration are all possible symptoms and signs of ulcerative colitis. 

 
Malnutrition**************************************************

Malnutrition is the lack of adequate nutrition, either as a result of imbalances, deficiencies, or excesses in a person's intake of food and nutrients. This can be due to eating too little, eating an improper diet, or having a medical condition that results in the body's being unable to use food and nutrients. Malnutrition can also refer to overnutrition and obesity and is the condition of being poorly nourished.
 
Unsteady Gait**************************************************

An unsteady gait is an abnormality in walking that can be caused by diseases of or damage to the legs and feet (including the bones, joints, blood vessels, muscles, and other soft tissues) or to the nervous system that controls the movements necessary for walking.
 
Unusual Behavior**************************************************

The observation of strange behavior depends at least in part upon the perceptions of the observer. For most people, behaviors that are observed as out of the ordinary or strange are a feature of psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and other mental-health conditions. Examples of conditions in which psychosis (altered perception of reality) are present include schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. People suffering from psychosis may have an altered perception of reality that often affects their behavior, leading them to act in ways that may be perceived as strange. Problems controlling one's behavior can also occur as a result of brain damage or disorders. People suffering from dementia may display strange behaviors. Behavioral changes can be accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms or by physical symptoms if they are related to a medical condition.  Substance abuse and drug overdoses can also lead to problems with behavior.
 
Upper Respiratory Infection**************************************************

Upper respiratory infections (URI) are very common and include the common cold and flu. An upper respiratory infection is defined as an infection of any of the structures of the upper respiratory tract: the sinuses, nasal passages, pharynx, and larynx. Examples of specific types of upper respiratory infection include rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal cavity), sinusitis (sinus infection), nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nasal cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, uvula, and tonsils), pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx, uvula, and tonsils), laryngitis (inflammation of the larynx), and epiglottitis (inflammation of the upper portion of the larynx or the epiglottis). Viruses cause most upper respiratory infections, although bacteria and fungi can also infect these areas.
 
Bladder Spasms**************************************************

A bladder spasm occurs when the bladder muscle squeezes suddenly without warning, causing an urgent need to release urine. A bladder spasm is referred to medically as a contraction of the detrusor muscle. The spasm can be so severe as to cause the leakage of urine (incontinence), which is characteristic of the condition urge incontinence, or overactive bladder. Sometimes, a bladder spasm is associated with severe cramping, burning, or pain. Bladder spasms can occur in people of any age. They are a common cause of daytime incontinence in children. They can be related to medical conditions that interfere with the function of the nervous system or may be related to infections or damage to the bladder itself. Certain medications and foods are also irritating to the bladder and may cause bladder spasms.
 
Urinary Retention**************************************************

Symptoms of urinary retention include the inability to urinate, which occurs when an individual is not fully able to empty his or her bladder, despite having the urge to urinate. Urinary retention may be an acute (happening suddenly) or longstanding (chronic) problem in both men or women and can be associated with other bladder problems or abnormalities within the pelvis. Urinary retention is more common in men than women and increases in frequency as men age. Any condition that results in a physical blockage of the urethra (the tube through which urine exits the bladder) can result in the inability to urinate. Another cause of urinary retention is a defect or disruption in the function of the nerves that control urination. Some medications can cause or worsen urinary retention. Examples of these include general anesthetic agents, stimulants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed and others) and phenylpropanolamine (Dexatrim and others), and antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton). 
 
Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**************************************************
Symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) are similar in men, women, and 
children. Early symptoms and signs are usually easy to recognize and primarily involve pain, discomfort, or burning when trying to 
urinate. Accompanying this can be the sense that one needs to urinate urgently 
(known as urinary urgency) or the need for frequent urination (called urinary 
frequency). Even when there is a strong urge to urinate, you may pass only a 
small amount of urine. The urine itself may appear bloody or cloudy. Men may 
feel pain in the rectum, while women may experience pain around the pubic bone.

 
Urinary Urgency**************************************************

Urinary urgency is the sudden urge to urinate, due to involuntary contractions of the bladder muscle. Urinary urgency is one of the hallmark symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) and can be related to other conditions as well. Certain medications, like diuretics, can also cause urinary urgency. Damage to the nerves that control the bladder or conditions like overactive bladder are characterized by urinary urgency. Urinary urgency is related to and often accompanied by urinary frequency, the need to urinate frequently. The two symptoms are sometimes confused with each other. For example, people with uncontrolled diabetes often experience the need to urinate frequently and may describe feeling urinary urgency as a result.

 
Urine Odor**************************************************

Normal urine is clear and has a straw-yellow color. While the odor of urine can vary somewhat, in most cases, it does not have a strong smell. With dehydration, the urine is more concentrated and may have a stronger ammonia scent than normal. Consumption of certain foods, such as asparagus (which can impart a characteristic odor to urine), and taking some medications may be causes for changes in the odor of urine. The presence of bacteria in the urine, such as with a  
urinary tract infection (UTI), can affect the appearance and smell of urine. When there is an infection in the urinary tract, the urine may take on a foul-smelling odor as well as appear 
cloudy or
bloody. A burning sensation during urination may be a symptom of a UTI. The urine may also have an abnormally sweet odor in uncontrolled diabetes, and some rare genetic conditions can also cause the urine to have an abnormal 
or strange odor.

 
Vaginal Bleeding**************************************************

Normal vaginal bleeding is the periodic blood that flows as a discharge from the woman's uterus as a result of normal cyclic hormonal changes each month. Normal vaginal bleeding is also called menorrhea. The process by which menorrhea occurs is called menstruation.
 
Vaginal Discharge**************************************************
A certain amount of vaginal discharge (fluid that flows out the vaginal 
opening) other than the expected vaginal bleeding at menstruation is normal. The 
vaginal walls and uterine cervix contain glands that produce a small amount of 
fluid that helps to keep the vagina clean. This normal fluid is usually thin and 
clear or milky white and does not have an unpleasant smell. Vaginal discharge is 
thicker at specific times of the menstrual cycle (at the time of ovulation), 
during breastfeeding, or during sexual arousal. This temporary thickening of the 
vaginal discharge is normal and is not associated with the symptoms and signs of 
vaginal infection.
 
Vaginal Dryness**************************************************
Vaginal dryness is often due to deficiency of the female hormone estrogen, frequently associated with menopause. There are many other causes of vaginal dryness. Sometimes vaginal dryness is a result of local skin conditions of the genital area. Vaginal dryness can also be a feature of systemic diseases, such as 
Sjögren's syndrome. Frequently, no specific cause of vaginal dryness can be identified.
 
Vaginal Itching**************************************************
Although vaginal itching is the hallmark of yeast infections and other vaginal infections (including 
sexually transmitted diseases 
[STDs]), itching in the vagina and vulvar areas has multiple causes. Vaginal itching can also arise due to chemical irritants that may be found in detergents or soaps, 
douches and vaginal creams, toilet paper, bath products, feminine hygiene products, and vaginal contraceptive products.
 
Vaginal Odor**************************************************

Vaginal odor is typically from inflammation of the vaginal area. Inflammation of the vaginal area can occur because of poor hygiene but is often a result of infection in or around the vagina.  A common infection that can cause vaginal odor is overgrowth of the normal vaginal bacteria to cause bacterial vaginosis. The sexually transmitted disease trichinosis can cause vaginal odor. Uncommon causes of vaginal odor include cancers and an abnormal passageway between the rectum and vagina (rectovaginal fistula). 
 
Vaginal Pain**************************************************
Pain in the vagina or the female external genital organs (the vulva, which includes the labia, clitoris, and entrance to the vagina) most commonly is a result of infection. Vaginal pain during sexual intercourse is referred to as 
dyspareunia. Infection of the vagina is referred to as vaginitis. Vaginal pain can be a result of injury or trauma to the vagina or vulva.
The medical term for vaginal pain is vulvodynia.
 
Vaginal Yeast Infection**************************************************
Even though the symptoms produced by a vaginal yeast infection (also referred 
to as vaginal candidiasis or yeast vaginitis) are similar among affected women, they are not at all specific. In fact, studies have shown that many women attempt to treat what they believe are the early symptoms and signs of a vaginal yeast infection  using over-the-counter medications when they actually have a different condition. So, if you are unsure about whether or not you have a yeast infection, or if you have never had one before, it's important to see 
a doctor to be sure that you are treating the correct conditions before starting any treatment.
 
Vertical Ridges on the Fingernails**************************************************

Having vertical (longitudinal) ridges on the fingernails refers to the presence of tiny raised lines or ridges that run up and down the length of the nail. Ridges are among the different kinds of nail abnormalities that can develop due to aging, nail injury, or trauma, or underlying medical conditions. Many people notice an increase in vertical ridges of the fingernails as they age, and this can be a normal development. Aging has been described as the predominant cause of vertical ridges on the fingernails. 
Onychorrhexis is the medical term used to describe longitudinal ridges on the nails that often accompany brittle nails.
 
Vertigo**************************************************
Vertigo is a feeling that one is dizzily turning around or that one's surroundings are dizzily spinning or turning about. People experiencing vertigo may feel that they are swaying, tilting, or are pulled to one direction. Vertigo is usually due to a problem with the inner ear but can also be caused by vision problems and other conditions. Vertigo is medically distinct from dizziness, lightheadedness, and unsteadiness in that vertigo involves the sensation of movement. Vertigo may be described as a feeling that 
one is spinning around, known as subjective vertigo, or the feeling of rotation of the surrounding environment, known as objective vertigo. The spinning sensation of vertigo may be accompanied by other symptoms, including
 
Vision Loss**************************************************

Loss of vision can occur suddenly or develop gradually over time. Vision loss may be complete (involving both eyes) or partial, involving only one eye or even certain parts of the visual field. Vision loss is different from blindness that was present at birth, and this article is concerned with causes of vision loss in an individual who previously had normal vision. Vision loss can also be considered as loss of sight that cannot be corrected to a normal level with eyeglasses. The causes of loss of vision are extremely varied and range from conditions affecting the eyes to conditions affecting the visual processing centers in the brain. 
Impaired vision becomes more common with age. Common causes of vision loss in the elderly include diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts.
 
Vitamin B12 Deficiency**************************************************

Vitamin B12 is a vitamin that is essential for many body functions, including the production of red blood cells. The body cannot make vitamin B12, and it needs to be supplied through the diet or by taking supplements. Vitamin B12 is found in foods of animal origin like meats, eggs, milk, and cheese. Vitamin B12 deficiency 
(cobalamin deficiency) is a condition that results when there is too little vitamin B12 in the body. Pernicious anemia is a kind of anemia that happens when the body is not able to absorb vitamin B12 through the digestive tract. A mild deficiency of vitamin B12 may not produce symptoms. Symptoms and signs, when they occur, can be similar to those of anemia, including
 
Vocal Outbursts**************************************************

Vocal outbursts can be voluntary (controlled) or semi-voluntary (occurring as a response to an impulse that is largely beyond an individual's control). Involuntary (or semi-voluntary) vocal outbursts are a feature of certain neurological conditions characterized by other types of 
tics, such as involuntary movements. The classic example is 
Tourette syndrome, but other neurological disturbances can result in vocal outbursts as well. Psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia may have vocal outbursts as a symptom, and some people suffering from dementia or other forms of damage to the brain may display vocal outbursts in the form of uncontrolled or dysregulated speech. 
Alcohol and 
drug use can also lead to impairment of behavior and control, leading sometimes to vocal outbursts.
 
Tic**************************************************

A tic is a repetitive and spasmodic contraction of the muscles, usually of the face. It appears as an uncontrollable movement of the body and  may be referred to as a twitch, spasm, motor tic, or jerk. Examples may include blinking the eyes, grimaces, grunts, groans, tongue clicking, throat clearing, or twitching the nose. Tics can also occur outside the facial muscles in the arms or legs, but this is less common. In contrast to motor tics described above, vocal tics are repeated sounds or words that occur without intention. Tics are more common in children than adults, and boys are more commonly affected than girls. Tics can be suppressed if a person concentrates on suppressing them, but this becomes increasingly difficult with time. Tics are a characteristic symptom of Tourette syndrome and tic disorders, but they may also occur due to other medical conditions.
 
Vomiting**************************************************
Vomiting, along with nausea, is a symptom of an underlying disease rather than a specific illness itself. Emesis is the medical term for vomiting. Vomiting is the forcible emptying of the stomach in which the stomach has to overcome the pressures that are normally in place to keep food and secretions within the stomach. Causes of vomiting are varied and include 
food-borne illnesses (food poisoning), infections, problems with the brain and central nervous system, and systemic (body-wide) diseases. Some illnesses will cause nausea and vomiting, even though there is no direct involvement of the stomach or gastrointestinal tract. Examples can include pneumonia, heart attack, and sepsis. Vomiting may be a side effect of medications, including drugs used in cancer chemotherapy, as well as a side effect of radiation therapy.
 
Vomiting Blood**************************************************
The medical term for vomiting blood (bloody vomit) is hematemesis.
Blood in vomit can be due to minor or major health problems.  It can be minimal or great in amount. Vomiting blood should be evaluated by a health care professional.
 
Watery Eye**************************************************

Tearing is a normal function of the eye. Excessive tearing, or teary eyes that are not from normal crying, can be a sign of an underlying health condition or disease. The tears of the eye come from the tear gland, called the lacrimal gland, which is located above the outer eye. Tears are composed of water, oil, and antibodies. The moisture from tears on the front of the eye, the cornea, is essential to prevent damage to the cornea from drying and becoming inflamed (keratitis) leading to corneal abrasion and corneal ulcer.
 
Weakness**************************************************

Weakness is a decrease in the strength in one or more muscles. In the strictest sense, the medical definition of weakness refers to loss of muscle strength, and this article is focused upon conditions that can result in a measurable loss of muscle function. Weakness may be generalized or may affect one muscle or muscle group exclusively. Diseases of the neuromuscular system, injuries, metabolic diseases, and toxins can all cause of measurable muscle weakness. Signs and symptoms of weakness can include trouble doing daily tasks, such as grooming or writing or problems with gait and loss of balance.
 
Weight Gain**************************************************
Weight gain can result from an increase in body fluid, muscle mass, or fat. An increase in body fluid can come from medications, fluid and salt retention, intravenous fluid infusion, kidney or heart failure. An increase in muscle mass is commonly seen with exercising. An increase in body fat is commonly seen as a result of diet or lack of exercise as the body converts muscle to fat. An excessive weight gain is referred to as obesity. Obesity is a function of environmental (diet, exercise, lifestyle, etc.), hormonal, and inherited (genetic) factors in varying degrees. Weight gain is a normal part of pregnancy.
 
Weight Loss**************************************************
Weight loss can be intentional, such as from 
dieting and exercise, or 
unintentional and be a manifestation of illness. Weight loss can result from a 
decrease in body fluid, muscle mass, or fat. A decrease in body fluid can come 
from medications, fluid loss, lack of fluid intake, or illnesses such as 
diabetes. A decrease in body fat can be intentionally caused by exercise and 
dieting, such as for overweight or obesity. Weight loss is normal after 
pregnancy. Other causes of weight loss include, but are not limited to, cancer, 
viral infection (such as 
CMV or 
HIV), gastroenteritis, parasite infection, depression, bowel diseases, and overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).
 
West Nile Virus**************************************************
Most people infected with the West Nile virus do not develop an illness or any symptoms from the infection. However, an illness with fever occurs in about 
one out of every five people who become infected. The illness produces flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, body aches, joint pains, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, weakness, or rash. Rarely, in less than 1% of people who are infected, a serious illness with neurological complications develops. These people may develop inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). In this case, symptoms like high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, seizures, or paralysis can occur. Other possible symptoms of severe West Nile virus illness can include difficulty walking and sleepiness. Long-term persistent effects of the severe illness can cause insomnia, depression, memory loss, confusion, irritability, and fatigue.
 
Wheezing**************************************************

Wheezing is a whistling sound that occurs during breathing, usually during expiration (breathing air out of the lungs) through narrowed airways. Inflammation of the airways, bronchospasm (tightening of the muscles around the bronchial tubes), and hypersensitivity (reactivity to triggers such as allergens, irritants, or infections) all play a role in the development of wheezing. Any conditions or diseases that can constrict the airways can lead to wheezing. Wheezing can be accompanied by other symptoms such as 
coughing and shortness of breath. Wheezing may also occur in anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening 
allergic reaction.
 
White Tongue**************************************************

Whitening of the tongue can occur when there is a buildup or coating of bacteria and debris on the surface of the tongue due to mild dehydration, illness (when there is less use of the tongue for talking or eating), or 
dryness of the mouth. A whitening of the top layer of the tongue or the presence of white spots or patches on the tongue can also be seen with infection, irritation, or chronic inflammation of the surface of the tongue. Certain oral infections, notably 
Candida yeast infections (known as oral thrush), are characterized by a white tongue. These yeast infections may be seen in many different circumstances but are common in people with immune suppression due to conditions such as cancer or HIV infection.  In contrast, some infections, like scarlet fever, can produce red spots on the tongue. Inflammation and whitening of the tongue can also occur due to dryness or environmental irritants such as smoking or other 
tobacco use, and may be associated with bad breath. Inflammation of the tongue is known as glossitis. Some white patches on the tongue, known as leukoplakia, can be precancerous lesions. Geographic tongue is a condition in which some areas of the tongue lack the papillae normally present on the tongue surface, resulting in irregular red patches on the tongue with a white border.
 
Wrist Pain**************************************************

Wrist pain can be caused by disease or injury affecting any aspect of the wrist joint, including the bones, ligaments, and connective tissue surrounding the area. Joint pain is medically known as arthralgia. Pain is a feature of joint inflammation (arthritis) that may occur in the wrist. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the most common types of arthritis to occur in the wrist.  
Repetitive-motion injuries can cause pain in the wrist and hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an impingement on the median nerve in the area of the wrist that can cause numbness, 
tingling, and eventually pain or cramping in the hand. Trauma or injuries such as 
strains and sprains can also cause wrist pain. 
De Quervain's disease is an inflammation of the tendons that begins in the thumb and extends to the wrist; this condition is another potential cause of wrist pain. Tumors of the bones or other structures in the hand are a very rare cause of wrist pain.
 
Yawning**************************************************

Yawning is the involuntary opening of the mouth while taking in a long breath of air. Yawning is associated with sleepiness or drowsiness. Almost anything that causes drowsiness, ranging from tiredness to certain medications, can lead to yawning. Conditions like sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome can cause yawning due to daytime sleepiness. Excessive yawning is yawning that occurs beyond the amount expected even for someone who is sleepy. A vasovagal reaction is a process in the body that can trigger yawning. It can be caused by a heart attack or aortic dissection.
 
Zika Virus Infection**************************************************

The Zika virus is transmitted to humans by the 
bite of a mosquito that carries the virus. When it causes symptoms (in about 
one out of every five infections), it typically produces a disease that lasts a few days to a week. Common Zika fever symptoms 
and signs include
